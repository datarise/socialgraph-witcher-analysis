Anaïs La Valette was the daughter of Mary Louisa La Valette and sister of Boussy. Who her father was is not known for sure. Officially, it was the Old Baron La Valette, but many rumors persist that she and her brother were actually King Foltest of Temeria's progeny. If this is true, then both she and her brother were in line for the Temerian throne. In Chapter II, if Geralt chose Roche's path, he learned that Boussy was accidentally killed in the attempt to kidnap the siblings, leaving Anaïs the sole heir to the throne. If Geralt handed her over to John Natalis, Roche will later inform Geralt that when Natalis tried to give her a doll to play with, she refused, stating she wanted a sword and to learn how to fight.    The daughter of Baroness Mary Louisa La Valette was a scant few summers old at the time. Rumors that King Foltest was her father gave beginning to many important events.    The Assassins of Kings Of His Blood and Bone    Of His Blood and Bone is a quest related to a kidnapped Anaïs that Geralt must free. You can unlock this quest only if you chose to side with Roche at the end of Chapter I, and if you choose to follow Vernon after For Temeria! quest, in Chapter III, instead of saving Triss. During the whole game she does not say anything directly. In the novel Blood of Elves it is only said that Maria Luiza and King Foltest were in love, but nothing about common children.
