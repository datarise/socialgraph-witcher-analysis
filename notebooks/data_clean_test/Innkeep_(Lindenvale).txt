There are actually two innkeeps in Lindenvale. Both work in the tavern behind the village's noticeboard, one during the day, and one during the evening. The night innkeep a few herbs, some food and drink, and pure silver on the other hand the day innkeep sells herbs, powdered pearl, and pure silver.    Night innkeep looks exactly like Marcus T.K. Hodgson, the bookseller in Novigrad.
