Vencel Pugg was an alchemist and generally shady character who asked Geralt to get him the formula for a particular type of incense which is manufactured and distributed by a vendor in Flotsam. He can be found hanging out near the docks early in Chapter I.    The Scent of Incense    Vencel Pugg seems to be a member of Salamandra. He is a fisstech dealer and during the conversation with Geralt in his lab (only if Geralt accepts to give him the recipe, whatever real or false), he mentions that he dealt with Roland Bleinheim of Vizima.
