Rufus was a Redanian soldier stationed between Novigrad and Oxenfurt in 1272. Being a soldier, he knew the general situation of what was going on during the Third Northern War. At one point, he ended up camping out with two others: a merchant named Manfred and a sorcerer named Theophile Maria Rosco. If Geralt stops by to talk and refuses to get involved or helps Rufus: Rufus killed Manfred, believing he was a spy, though he had no proof. On searching Manfred's body, he felt the Nilfgaardian florens the merchant had been carrying were enough to justify his suspicions. If Geralt stops by to talk but then defends Manfred: Sadly, Geralt had no other choice but to kill Rufus, who was dead set on killing Manfred, believing he was a spy. If Geralt stops by but leaves after introduction: Rufus remained passive, and the original three men continued to camp out.    Strangers in the Night
