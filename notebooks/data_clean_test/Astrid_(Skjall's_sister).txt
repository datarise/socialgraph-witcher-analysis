Astrid was a young woman living in Lofoten with her brother, Skjall, and their mother. One day, her brother brought home an injured Ciri while the mysterious elf that was with Ciri went off to find a boat. After Ciri woke up, Astrid took her to the sauna to help her heal while her brother went to ready a couple horses to get Ciri to her destination. At the sauna, Astrid and her mother talked with Ciri about her life as someone from the continent. After Ciri finished up at the sauna, she headed off to the barn. Astrid and her mother most likely died when the Wild Hunt, looking for Ciri, attacked Lofoten, as nobody knew what happened to Ciri when Geralt and Yennefer later passed through the village looking for answers.    Astrid appears to have two different hair colors. When she's dressed, her hair appears black, but when she changes to use the sauna, her hair appears brown.
