Old Sage was a soothsayer living in Benek who got his seer abilities in his youth when he got hit in the back of the head with a rock. However, his gift doesn't let him see what would help him win at gwent but, despite this, he's considered one of Velen's best gwent players. He uses the Monsters deck and if beaten he gives the Crone: Weavess card as a reward.    Gwent: Velen Players The Truth is in the Stars    The joke the old sage told about falling into a witch's magical brew as a child before getting his visions could be a reference to Obelix from Asterix and Obelix comic series, who fell into his village druid's brew of potion as a baby which made him inhumanly strong.
