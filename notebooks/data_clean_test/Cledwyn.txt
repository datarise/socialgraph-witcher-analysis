Cledwyn was the imperial barber of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis and subordinate of Mererid, the emperor's chamberlain. He was the who shaved off Geralt's beard, when the witcher visited the emperor in 1272, while General Voorhis asked some questions about recent events.    Imperial Audience    Morvran Voorhis interviews Geralt while being shaved, explaining that "men turn honest when they feel a blade at their throat." In-game, the floating text only names him "barber".
