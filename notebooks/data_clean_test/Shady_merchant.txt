If Geralt talks to him: he'll offer Geralt a pass for 100 . If the witcher balked at it, he then offered a discount if the witcher would help his brother-in-law, Albin Hart. If Geralt helps Albin and he survives: pleased, the merchant then offered to sell the pass to Geralt for 25 . If Geralt helps Albin but he dies: upset over this, the merchant refused to do anymore business with Geralt.
