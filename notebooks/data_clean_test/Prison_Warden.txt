An unnamed Prison Warden was a high-ranking official of the witch hunters who presided over Deireadh prison and commanded its garrison until 1272. During his infiltration of the prison, Geralt of Rivia killed the warden in order to obtain the cell key, which would be used to free Margarita Laux-Antille.    The warden emerges from his quarters after most of the witch hunters and Redanian soldiers guarding the courtyard of the prison have been killed. He wields a two-handed sword in combat. After being hit once, he parries the second strike and stuns Geralt.    Upon death, the warden drops one pair of dimeritium shackles, a witch hunter's sword, and the cell key.    The Great Escape
