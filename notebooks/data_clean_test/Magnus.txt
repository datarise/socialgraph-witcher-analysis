Magnus was the blacksmith at the Kaedweni camp and an avid arm wrestler. He could be found in the Lower Kaedweni camp, near the tent of the merchant Lasota.

Magnus was a reliable artisan, a huge man with the strength of a bull. Rumor had it that his grip was not unlike that of iron pincers.    Bring it on: Kaedweni Camp
