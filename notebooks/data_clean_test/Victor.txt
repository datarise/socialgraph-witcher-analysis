Victor was a bard traveling with a fellow bard, Gascoigne, along the road to Yantra in 1272 when the two had stopped to set up a small campfire and drink. If Geralt partakes in drinking with them: after Geralt fell asleep, the two bards took all the witcher's possessions and ran off to Yantra, intending to sell the items.  ...and demands their stuff: already pissed off, Geralt caught up to them and not only demanded his stuff back but their stuff as well, leaving the bards clad only in their underwear. ...and forgives them: on catching up to them, Geralt decided to just demand back his stuff, which the bards readily handed over.
