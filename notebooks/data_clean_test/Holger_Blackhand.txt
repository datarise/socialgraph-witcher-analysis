Holger Blackhand was the jarl of Faroe, and the leader of Clan Dimun.    The dour-faced jarl of Faroe owed his nickname to the dark coloring of his hand and forearm, left there by frostbite he suffered when his longship hit an underwater boulder during a freak autumn blizzard. Even judging by Skellige standards, where pillaging and plundering are practically rites of passage, Holger was considered a brutal pirate and raider. This opinion surely resulted from the fact that he attacked the villages and ships of enemy Skellige clans with as much nerve as he did the coastal settlements of Cidaris, Novigrad and Nilfgaard.
