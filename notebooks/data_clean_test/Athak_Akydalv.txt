Athak Akydalv was a rock troll and professional fist fighter who held the title of Champion of Champions in 1272. Upon his arrival at the arena in Hov on the island of Spikeroog, Athak won the title by defeating Zama, the previous Champion of Champions. For Geralt to earn the title Champion of Champions, he must defeat the previously-reigning fist fighting champions of Novigrad, Velen, and Skellige, and finally Athak. It is not explicitly stated if Athak also defeated the previously-reigning champions.
