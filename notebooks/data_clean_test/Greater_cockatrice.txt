The greater cockatrice is better known as the "beast of the sewers". It is larger than regular cockatrices and threatens the Temple Quarter should it escape the sewers. Even the Order of the Flaming Rose has taken an interest, as has the City Guard. Vincent Meis offers to pay for the creature's head, but should you miss your rendezvous with Vincent in Chapter II, the Royal huntsman will also provide a reward for the head in Chapter III.    The Beast of the Sewers    This is the only trophy quest which is not optional. The remains of the creature contain one of the sephirot necessary to complete Chapter II.
