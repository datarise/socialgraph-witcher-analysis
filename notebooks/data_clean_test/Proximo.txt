Proximo Woodblade was the arena master of the arena in the Kaedweni camp in 1271.    Proximo was responsible for the fighting in the arena, which was a form of entertainment which very much pleased King Henselt. He was also responsible for the reward offered in an announcement he posted on the notice board for getting rid of the rotfiends which plagued the areas around the camp.    Proximo, the arena master, had a talent for oration and the fights he organized were famous in all of Kaedwen and beyond. Blows rained down, armor fragments and teeth flew left and right â€“ in other words, the audience found his arena to be equal to the merry dancing of a fair day.    Ave Henselt!
