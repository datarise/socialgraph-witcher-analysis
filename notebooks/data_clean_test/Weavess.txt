Weavess was one of the three Velen Crones in Crookback Bog. The other two were Whispess and Brewess and they were the supposed to be the daughters of She-Who-Knows.    If Ciri doesn't come back from fighting the White Frost: Geralt afterwards ventured into the Bog and killed Weavess, reclaiming Cirilla's medallion.    Though the youngest of the three Crones, the Weavess was not one jot less ugly or evil than her older sisters.

She was able to escape by transforming into a flock of ravens and took Cirilla's medallion with her.
