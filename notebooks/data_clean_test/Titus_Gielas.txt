Titus Gielas was a fisstech dealer who in 1272, was nearly killed during a deal gone wrong with a priest of the Eternal Fire.    The priest of the Eternal Fire had been a customer of Titus', buying fisstech off him three times without a hassle. That changed one day though, where the priest decided to silence Titus completely and had his thugs attack him, then left him for dead, hoping the necrophages in the area would kill him. If Geralt saves Titus then questions him: The priest hired Geralt to burn the bodies in the area, claiming that it'd prevent the spread of disease and necrophages. However, Geralt found Titus fighting a pack of ghouls and jumped in to help him out. Afterwards, Titus revealed what had transpired beforehand before deciding he had enough of the area and was going to leave. If Geralt saves him but doesn't question him: Having enough with the area and nearly being killed for it, Titus proclaimed he was leaving, even if it meant traveling all the way to Poviss. If Geralt doesn't save him: Unfortunately for Titus, he was killed by the ghouls in the area and thus all evidence of the priest's crimes disappeared.    Funeral Pyres
