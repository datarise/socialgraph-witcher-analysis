Narcissa was a prostitute working in the Passiflora in 1272. Despite the Eternal Fire condemning prostitution, many Temple Guards use the Passiflora's services and treat the women well.    Due to her using the same hair model as Tamara Strenger, some players confuse her with the Bloody Baron's daughter.
