Theophile Maria Rosco was a mage passing through between Novigrad and Oxenfurt when he set up camp with two others: a Redanian soldier named Rufus and a merchant named Manfred.    Strangers in the Night    Regardless how Strangers in the Night is done, he remains neutral, staying out of the argument. Oddly, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt: Official Prima Guide lists his middle name as "Mario" instead of "Maria". It is unclear what caused this discrepancy. Considering Radovid V's stance on killing every mage, it's unclear why Rufus doesn't bother Theophile. It's suggested that maybe Theophile is supporting Radovid's plan somehow or just a developer oversight.
