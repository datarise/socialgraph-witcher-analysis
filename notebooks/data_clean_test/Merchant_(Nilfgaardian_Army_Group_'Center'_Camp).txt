There are actually three merchants at the Nilfgaardian Army Group 'Center' Camp, not counting Quartermaster Tavar Eggebracht.     This merchant is the one furthest north of the three and wears a burgundy chaperon hat. He sells a mix of goods including diagrams.     This merchant is just south of the one with the burgundy chaperon and sells the usual mix of random armor, weapons, and crafting components.     This merchant is to the west of the other two and near the unnamed noblewoman that gives the secondary quest, Blood Ties. He sells alchemy ingredients.
