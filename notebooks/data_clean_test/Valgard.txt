Valgard was a fistfighter in Skellige in 1272. He can be found just outside the door to Yennefer's room at New Port Inn in Kaer Trolde Harbour. If Geralt fights him: Knowing he had no chance against a witcher, he talked to Geralt in private, asking him to throw the match so he could impress Eryka, a woman he was interested in.  If Geralt loses the first match: Valgard thanked the witcher as Eryka approached, clearly impressed with his fighting ability. If Geralt doesn't throw the first match: Miffed, Eryka showed her disappointment in Valgard and walked off, despite Valgard calling after her.    Fists of Fury: Skellige
