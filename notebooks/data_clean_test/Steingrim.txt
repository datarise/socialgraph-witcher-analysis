Steingrim was the first Skelliger that Geralt met after washing up on the shore of Ard Skellig, the largest of the Skellige Isles. He had a companion, a wolf named Trofast. He made a living by scavenging off of dead bodies that washed up on the shore, though he made the mistake of trying this on Geralt and was taken by surprise as a result. He is one of the many victims who died at the hand of the berserkers transformation in Kaer Trolde during the feast.    Destination: Skellige King's Gambit    The name of the wolf, "Trofast", is Norwegian for "Faithful".
