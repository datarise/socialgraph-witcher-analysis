Tobias Hoffman was the mayor and chief of the village of Murky Waters. He had two daughters, Alina, the bride to be, and Celina, her jealous older sister. He considered Adam, whom he knew to be infatuated with his daughter, to be a fool. He had a fairly peculiar manner of speaking and seemed to like choosing nicknames for people. He continually referred to Geralt as "Beastie baiter". His other hobbies included dice poker, in which he was a professional level player. During the day, he can be found at his house, or rather one of his houses, if the innkeeper is to be believed. He is usually inside, but occasionally goes outside for a breath of fresh air. When asked about witcher work, he mentions that he will pay for the heads of Teyu and Ureus, monsters currently plaguing the peaceful surroundings.
