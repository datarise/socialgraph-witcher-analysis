Bolton of Ironford was a Nordling knight.    Sometime in the 13th century, Bolton and his squire traveled to Temeria to enlist in its notorious Grand Arena. Unluckily, necrophages ambushed them just when they were nearing the arena gates. Alone as the squire fled and died in a nearby river, Bolton fought the beasts off but was badly wounded. Luckily, Geralt of Rivia was passing by a while later and made him a healing brew. Bolton then gave Geralt his arena invitation to show his gratitude.    In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Polish version, he's named "Eryk of the Crossing" (Eryk z Przeprawy). Reason for this remains unknown.
