Caroline was Alvin's foster mother. She died in the fangs of barghests one night on her way to the Inn with the boy in the opening sequence of Chapter I. We know she was not his biological mother because of a conversation Alvin has with Geralt at the Inn the following day. During that conversation, Alvin mentions that his parents were already dead and that he has no other kin whatsoever.
