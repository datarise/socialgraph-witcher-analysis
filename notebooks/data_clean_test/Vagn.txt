Vagn was the elder of Fyresdal in 1272. However, despite being an elder he lacked wisdom in regards to monsters: in particular being able to tell a dragon from a forktail and instead relied on folklore. If Geralt helps him out and lies: Vagn was short and to the point, claiming they had a dragon problem and so Geralt set abut helping him, eventually luring out the forktail with Mia. Not wanting to dampen the man's spirits, Geralt lied and told him it was a (now dead) dragon, much to Vagn's delight. If Geralt helps him out but tells the truth: Geralt helped out Vagn but soon learned it was just a common forktail, a much smaller looking creature compared to a dragon. However, when Geralt told Vagn this after killing it, Vagn claimed he could have dealt with the "forkytail" himself if he'd known and thus cut Geralt's agreed upon reward in half.    Contract: Dragon
