Olcan is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He seems to serve the deities Kreve, Freya and Melitele. He is killed by King Henselt during the preamble to Chapter II when a fight between the Kaedwenis and Aedirnians breaks out. He tries to stop the bloodshed but Henselt, blinded by rage, viciously slams him into a large stone obelisk, killing him. His death unleashes a series of strange happenings, including an eclipse. Later we learn that it has unleashed the full power of Sabrina's curse. Also he is the one responsible for Saskia's poisoning.    Prelude to War: Aedirn Prelude to War: Kaedwen The Walls Have Ears The Eternal Battle (his death unleashes these events)    Olcan, the priest from Prince Stennis' retinue, turned out to be directly responsible for the poisoning of Saskia. The clergyman apparently thought that a heavy dose of thaumador would be more effective than prayer or excommunication. Unfortunately, because he was already dead, he could not answer for his deed.
