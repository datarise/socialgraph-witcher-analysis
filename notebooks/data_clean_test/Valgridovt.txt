Valgridovt was a prince from a far away land around 1272 when a coup was instigated in his kingdom and the royal family was overthrown.    Viki was named protector of the young boy and the two boarded one of the two ships set for Beauclair, where they were likely seeking asylum. However, the usurper back home sent warriors after them and one of the ships wrecked on an island in Skellige, though luckily Viki and the young prince were on the other ship. The two made it as far as Ursten in Velen before their ship also crashed, stranding them in a foreign land and, to make matters worse, Viki couldn't speak any of the local language. They then took refuge in Widows' Grotto as Viki tried to figure out what to do next. If Geralt finds them and protects them: now that the last warrior that'd been following them was dead, Viki and Valgridovt set out once more. If Geralt finds them but stands aside: the boy's last line of defense was literally cut down in front of him by the warrior, who conversed with Valgridovt before taking him back home.
