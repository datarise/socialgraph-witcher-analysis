She-Troll of Vergen is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, who can be found in the ravines during Chapter II. She is also the wife of the Troll of Vergen. On Iorveth's path, in order to find Triss Merigold who has been kidnapped by the Kingslayer, Geralt must speak with the Troll of Vergen. The creature explains that he did find the sorceress after she fell from the sky. She was wounded and he tried to help her, but his jealous wife didn't appreciate the intruder, so she ran away leaving her husband.

Seeing no chance for dialogue, he ended the female troll's life. If Geralt chooses to help her against Adam Pangratt during Chapter II: Where is Triss Merigold?: Once more Geralt put the cart before the horse as the witchers' rules go and stood alongside the monster, rather than the humans. He even managed to convince the troll to return to her husband, who eagerly awaited her. The final episode took place when both creatures arrived in Vergen to help defend it. The Kaedweni had occasion to learn that the phrase "the monstrosities of war" can be more than a figure of speech.
