The Queen of the Night is a higher vampire who owns a brothel (The House of the Queen of the Night) in the Trade Quarter in Vizima. Most of the women working there are, like the Queen of the Night, vampires that take blood in addition to money as payment for their sexual services. Elder ones do not need blood to sustain their life, it is more like alcohol or the drug that they enjoy the most. The player has the choice to kill her or keep silent in exchange for a "ménage-à-quatre" with three of her bruxa "sisters".    Blue Eyes    The Queen reveals that Regis was once her lover. After the Blue Eyes quest, if Geralt returns to see the Queen of the Night, she and her entourage will be in their vampire form and remain that way for the rest of the act. Thereafter, they are inaccessible anyway.
