Mikkjal was the caretaker of Eldberg Lighthouse in western Ard Skellig and belonged to Clan Drummond in 1272.    He has a rather dark secret though: using his position as the lighthouse keeper, he made a deal with others to occasionally have some ships go "astray" by not lighting the fire and thus having them crash into the island and they'd then split the spoils. However, someone eventually found out and placed a strong curse on the lighthouse and against Mikkjal in particular, which caused not just a dense fog on the island but a strong wraith, known as a penitent, to appear.
