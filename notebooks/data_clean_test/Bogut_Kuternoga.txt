Bogut Kuternoga seems to be an early fence sketch. He is a character which was conceived, but not implemented, for The Witcher computer game. The sources of the items he sells including weapons, armour and jewellery are very suspicious. He would have wandered the streets of Vizima having no fixed address.    "Kuternoga" translates to "lame duck" in Polish.
