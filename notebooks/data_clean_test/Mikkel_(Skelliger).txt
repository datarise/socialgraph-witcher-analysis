Mikkel was the brother of the blacksmith Timmon.    In 1272, he and Ulf were escorting Timmon's fianc√©e, Agda, to where Timmon and Agda where getting married. Sadly a storm hit and the boat crashed, killing Agda. Rather than face their brother over their disgrace at failing to protect Agda, his two brothers then committed suicide to maintain their honor. Geralt can use Keira Metz's magic lamp to see the conversation Ulf and Mikkel had before they died and find their bodies.    The Price of Honor
