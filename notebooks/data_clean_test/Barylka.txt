If Geralt meets and follows the dog: Geralt, having rescued the dog from a pack of wolves, noted the dog was rather friendly and had a key sewn into its collar.

If Geralt doesn't save the dog: Unfortunately Barylka met their end when a pack of wolves attacked the dog, killing it. If Geralt helps but doesn't follow: Barylka tried to get the witcher to follow, but for whatever reason Geralt didn't. The dog was never seen again.    A Dog's Life
