Liva was a medic working in the Kaedweni camp in 1271.    Because the hygiene of nearly every army's troops leaves a lot to be desired, military brothels have a reputation as dens of questionable pleasure and indubitable gonorrhea.

A brothel without medical supervision can easily turn into a seed of infirmity, and that is just one step away from becoming a source of sabotage and damaging military capability.
