Isidor Kay (spelled "Isidor Quay" in the journal heading) is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He is a merchant, craftsman, and dice poker player who can be found in the Kaedweni camp, standing outside the tent northwest of Lasota's during Chapter II.    Whether it was building fortifications or constructing clever traps, dwarven technical skills had no equals and Isidor Kay used them well. The mercenary made money on the side, running a small stall in the royal camp.
