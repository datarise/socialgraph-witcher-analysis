Cecil Burdon was the alderman, or head man in Vergen and Skalen Burdon's legal guardian. Cecil can be found in his home in the far right region of Vergen.    When we arrived in Vergen, we learned that the town's elder was named Cecil Burdon. This former dwarven miner was typical of his kin - realistic, substantive and possessed of a sober outlook. Vergen needed an administrator like that, so Burdon was, beyond all doubt, the right dwarf in the right place.
