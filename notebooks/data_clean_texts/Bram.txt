Bram was a merchant who lived in White Orchard.    In May 1272, Bram was attacked by a royal griffin at the ford, while transporting a wagon of goods to his store. As the witchers Geralt of Rivia and Vesemir neared the ford, they heard Bram yelling for help and found him hiding under his wagon while nearby the griffin feasted on his dead mare. After Vesemir was clawed by the beast and it had flown off with the horse, the witchers helped the Bram up, who was eager to reward them. If Geralt accepts a reward: Bram was very thankful to the witchers, so he gave them a reward and went on his way. If Geralt refuses the reward: Geralt told the merchant that they had seen someone in trouble and decided to help, and that they needed to reward, which surprised Bram, who thought that witchers couldn't feel empathy. Later for helping him, Bram's cousin Elsa gave Geralt four roasted chicken legs. Bram then headed back to White Orchard and set up shop next to the White Orchard inn.
