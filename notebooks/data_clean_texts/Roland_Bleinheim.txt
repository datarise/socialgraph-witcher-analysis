Roland Bleinheim was the leader of the Salamandra operation in the Swamp. It is his men who kidnapped innocent brickmakers and forced them to gather beggartick for the fisstech labs. Vaska described him as "an evil man" and specifically asked Geralt to kill him. His brother (apparently) ran a similar operation in the sewers of Vizima.
