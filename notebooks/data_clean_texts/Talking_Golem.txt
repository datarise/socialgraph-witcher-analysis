Talking Golem is a golem created by Dearhenna to Guard his laboratory and encountered in The Secrets of Loc Muinne. It was created with a greater degree of intelligence, autonomy and judgement than normal golems. The golem's role was to greet "guests" and eliminate "intruders" to Dearhenna's laboratory.
