Berthold Candeleria was a merchant, craftsman, and dice poker player who can be found at the dwarven smithy south of Einar Gausel's house in the nonhuman district of Flotsam. Geralt can play dice with him.    A representative of a guild can be seen subtly threatening Berthold with setting his workshop on fire and breaking his arm, unless he joins the guild. Berthold, however, considers his weapons superior and refuses to change his prices and join the guild, despite the threats.    In some versions of the game (like the Enhanced Edition) he no longer sells any of the 3 Meteorite Ores.
