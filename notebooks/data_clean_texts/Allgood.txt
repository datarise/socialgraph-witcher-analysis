Allgood and his brother Semko were fist fighters brought on board to entertain King Demavend III in 1271 while he sailed on the Pontar. While the two brothers spared, Letho snuck on board and released a magic capsule that encased everything in its radius in ice, including Allgood and Semko. He ended up shattering when the ship began to fall apart.    The fist fighters were designed to evoke the concept of primitive, almost plebeian contests. Both strongmen have simple, bloated faces and frames that bear little resemblance to what we consider the athletic ideal today. Layers of blubber and a profusion of body hair emphasize the effect. Their boxing technique is also less than spectacular. It's a simple test of strength, with victory going to the last man standing.       He differs from his brother in that he bears a chest tattoo.
