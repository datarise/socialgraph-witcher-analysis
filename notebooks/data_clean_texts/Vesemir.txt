Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived. He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.    Considered among the oldest witchers remaining, Vesemir was born early enough to witness the construction of Kaer Morhen in the 11th century. His mentor and tutor was Barmin. In the second half of the 12th century, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an enraged mob led by group of mages and priests. Vesemir survived, either not present in the keep during the pogrom or mistaken as dead by the mob as he lay unconscious among the corpses of his fellows. While the pogrom was condemned, the school never regained its full functionality.         Vesemir accompanied by witchers-in-training    After the massacre, the school was run by Grandmaster Rennes, with Vesemir as second in command: a fencing instructor and precept for the witcher trainees, replacing Varin. At some point, he met Visenna outside Kaer Morhen, a sorceress who decided to give her child, a young boy named Geralt, to train as a witcher. Vesemir became a father figure to Geralt, but treated all young witchers with harsh affection. Apart from participating in the school's life, Vesemir also took some witcher contracts. One of his famous deeds involved disenchanting the curse afflicting the "Swan of Poviss". In 1217, during the celebration of Saovine, village of Fox Hollow in Toussaint was attacked by a horde of vampires led by Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, a higher vampire. Along with the villagers led by Germain, Vesemir managed to kick the vampires out of the village. The witcher however, knew that their victory was only temporary and that the vampires would strike again once they healed their wounds. He commanded the peasants to the castle of Tesham Mutna, where the higher Regis took shelter. Although Vesemir was injured in the clash, the peasants managed to capture the vampire. After chopping Regis into pieces, they buried his remains as deep as possible. While the treatment was insufficient to kill the higher vampire, it was more than enough to convince Regis to stop drinking blood and attacking the villagers. For some time, the School of the Wolf was funded by the monarchs of Kaedwen alongside the School of the Cat. Vesemir had to reluctantly cooperate with Guxart, the fencing master of the Cats. Originally not liking each other, the two grew to understand one another. The cooperation between the schools unfortunately had to cease, as the Cat Grandmaster Treyse and a group of students had secretly conspired with King Radowit II and the mage Astrogarus against the Wolves. A week before the planned tournament between the schools Vesemir and Guxart were put under arrest by king's men, thus spared from the massacre that occured. During the tournament, King Radowit betrayed both Cats and Wolves ordering his soldiers to shoot them all, resolving both his budget problems and imagined threats to his power in a simple but effective way. Both masters – or, technically, acting grandmasters since Treyse's and Rennes' deaths – were released some time later and allowed to rebuild the schools, on the condition that the royal money would be never given to them again and that the schools must operate alone and unfunded. The schools declined slowly, and the deaths of mage assistants and veteran witchers put a definite end to the Wolf School by the late 1230s or early 1240s, as children were no longer trained there after then.  During the winter of 1234, while fulfilling a contract in Oxenfurt, Vesemir briefly dated young lady Mignole. After noticing each other from afar, Vesemir received a secret letter from the woman inviting him. The two had a tryst, which was unfortunately interrupted by Mignole's father who'd learned of the affair. Vesemir fled, leaving his gambeson behind in the process, and had an arrest warrant for him put out by the father.         Wolves in their lair    Even though the school ceased to function, Vesemir and other witchers used to spend winters at Kaer Morhen. He allowed some non-Wolf witchers such as Coën, but forbade the entrance for the renegades, as in case of Brehen whose massacre at Iello was exceptional even amongst the other Cats.  Likely around 1242, Vesemir hosted Eskel's Surprise Child, Deidre Ademeyn, at the keep, which prompted a dyplomatic conflict with her brother and King Henselt's vassal, Merwin Ademeyn: Deidre was first in line to the throne, which did not suit her brother well. Ultimately the princess left the castle, however not without leaving a disfiguring scar at Eskel's face.    Decades later, in or around 1265, Geralt brought his surprise child, Cirilla, princess of Cintra, to be trained as a witcher. Vesemir taught her about the different monsters and herbs, leaving the physical training to Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and Coën. However, the witchers soon found out that Ciri was a source, as she entered into a trance when she accidentally drank white seagull. The third time, Ciri foretold the deaths of Geralt and Coën. The witchers then decided to summon an old friend, the sorceress Triss Merigold, to help Ciri, under that pretext that Vesemir's bones ached. Triss imposed some conditions to the witchers as she made them see the errors in their ways of treating Ciri, and Vesemir accepted the conditions despite the initial protests of some of the witchers.         Old Vesemir       In May 1272, on the trail of Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir rode to White Orchard, where at a ford they encountered a merchant being trapped by a royal griffin. While fighting it, the old witcher suffered deep clawing to the shoulder. After freeing the man, they rode into the village to the local inn, and the two spoke to the innkeeper, Elsa, while a tense atmosphere filled the tavern. After Geralt met Gaunter O'Dimm, he spoke to Vesemir and decided to go to the Nilfgaardian Garrison. After getting some buckthorn to lure the beast, Geralt and Vesemir waited in a field hidden with bait set out, and after the griffin landed, Vesemir gave Geralt his crossbow that he had won gambling. After the beast was killed, and Geralt had handed in its trophy, him and his old master headed back to the inn, where they were violently attacked by some racists. Following their deaths, the two witchers were shunned and told to leave, where they encountered Yennefer and a Nilfgaardian escort outside the inn. Yennefer explained that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, so Vesemir decided that he would head north to Kaer Morhen.    Vesemir spent the next couple of weeks working at Kaer Morhen, patching crumbled walls, with Eskel and Lambert, until Yennefer showed up, preparing the witchers for Geralt and Uma's return to the keep, much to Vesemir's annoyance, as she showed little care for manners. Once Geralt arrived, everyone set out to prepare for the Trial of the Grasses that was to be performed on Uma, who Vesemir looked after until the trail was ready, taking him to the mountains, where he noticed in moments of complete relaxation, he behaved differently. Vesemir then put him into a trance and Uma spoke in a different voice. They all met the following morning and Geralt brewed the The Decoctions of the Grasses and started the trial on Uma, which Vesemir helped with but hated watching, remembering the painful history of their school. He slept through the trial until the end, when Uma transformed into Avallac'h, an elven sage, who revealed that Ciri was on the Isle of Mists and Geralt needed to find her. He also told them that when they took Ciri from the isle, the Wild Hunt would be able find her immediately, so Vesemir suggested that Geralt bring Ciri to Kaer Morhen and they all face the Wild Hunt together. He planned to spend the time preparing the keep for the coming battle with Eskel and Lambert.    After Geralt and Ciri returned via portal from the Isle of Mists, she was overjoyed to see Vesemir. Yennefer, Triss Merigold, Ciri, Geralt and Vesemir all discussed things and then headed into the main keep. On the way Vesemir discussed flammable gasses and patching up walls with Ermion. Then all the people that had turned up discussed battle plans in the main keep, with Vesemir suggesting that they brew potions in the laboratory and use tools to clear the rubble blocking access to the armory, and then he and Geralt finished it off by laying out the final plan. After a couple of hours, the Wild Hunt attacked, and Vesemir fought them on the walls of the lowest courtyard of the keep, briefly arguing with Ciri because she had left the inner keep against orders. Becoming overwhelmed and with Imlerith's arrival, they decided to retreat to the main courtyard. The Wild Hunt quickly broke through the gate and froze Geralt while Ciri and Vesemir hid at the top of the courtyard. Trying to protect Ciri, Vesemir was attacked by Imlerith, who he stabbed through the leg. He then cut Eredin Bréacc Glas who dropped Ciri, so Vesemir used Aard to push her far away. Imlerith then jumped on him and started beating and choking him, while Eredin started trying to convince Ciri to join him, much to Vesemir's horror. He spoke to Ciri begging her to run before stabbing Imlerith in the side. Imlerith, enraged, broke his neck, ending the old witcher's life.    On the one year anniversary of his death, Ciri returned to Kaer Morhen. Recounting tales of her life story and drinking by a campfire in the shadow of the old keep, paying tribute and remembering her old friend and mentor.    In the game, Vesemir is one of the first people Geralt speaks to upon arrival at Kaer Morhen, and he is the one to guide the amnesiac through his first few uncertain steps around the keep. He also tells the witcher about skinning monsters, an extremely useful skill throughout the rest of the game. Of no less importance is the fact that he introduces the character of Berengar to the plot while filling our hero in on his forgotten past. Vesemir features prominently in the prologue and can usually be found wandering around the main hall on the ground floor of Kaer Morhen, or in the basement in the laboratory.    Vesemir is the oldest and most experienced witcher, possibly older than Kaer Morhen itself. He spends each winter in the fortress and sets off on the road when spring comes, just like all the other witchers. Despite his age, Vesemir is robust and lively. Many youngsters could envy him his health. An excellent fencer, he was the one who taught me swordsmanship. He has raised many witchers, including me. His disciples treat him like a father. Leo was probably the old witcher's last protégé — the boy's death shocked him. He was one of a few to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. He is well aware of the magnitude of the hatred some people feel for witchers.    In The Price of Neutrality premium module he is found just inside the walls of Kaer Morhen; more specifically, in the main courtyard. He can be found later near the ford closest to the camp.    The She-Wolf    Vesemir is the eldest and most experienced witcher; in fact, he may be older than Kaer Morhen itself. He spends each winter at the fortress and, like the others, sets off on his Path when spring comes. Vesemir is robust and lively despite his age, and many youngsters could envy him his health. An excellent fencer, he taught me all I know about sword fighting. As one of the few who survived the assault on Kaer Morhen, he is well aware of the intense hatred some harbor for witchers.           Vesemir mentoring young Ciri    Vesemir returned in The Witcher 3 as a key character and was voiced by William Roberts once again. The game began with Geralt and his old mentor on the trail of Yennefer, the former having woken from a dream of Kaer Morhen. Whether or not they discussed the dream, Vesemir then requested to see Yennefer's letter, remarking that it smelt of lilacs and gooseberries, Yennefer's preferred perfume. Afterwards, they proceeded onto White Orchard to ask the townsfolk whether they've seen the sorceress in black. Both he and Geralt killed a Griffin in order to earn info regarding Yennefer's location. On their way back to the inn, they were greeted by Yennefer in person. There, Vesemir separated from Geralt, wanting to return to Kaer Morhen to hide its path from the Northern realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard as they waged war on one another. Vesemir disappeared for the majority of the game until Geralt returned to Kaer Morhen with Yennefer, then Ciri, where a group of resistance fighters were formed to fend off the Wild Hunt. During the battle, the King of the Wild Hunt detonated a magical explosion that froze all opposition, where only Vesemir and Ciri were unscathed. Vesemir tried to retreat with Ciri in tow but was immediately confronted by Eredin and Imlerith, the king and the second in command of the Wild Hunt respectively. Vesemir fended them off until Imlerith disarmed him, Ciri was then ready to surrender herself to the Hunt in order to spare everyone involved. In a last-ditch effort, Vesemir stabbed Imlerith in the abdomen with a hidden dagger, causing the Aen Elle general to snap his neck, killing him. Distraught at this, Ciri unleashed her power in a massive soundwave of energy that forced the Hunt to retreat. After the battle, Vesemir was then given a funeral and honored as a hero against the Wild Hunt, Ciri took his Wolf medallion as a memento.  In the Hearts of Stone expansion, Geralt came across a former lover of Vesemir's. If she is encountered after The Battle of Kaer Morhen, Geralt informs her of Vesemir's death. However, if she is encountered beforehand, there is an extra dialogue option for Geralt to ask Vesemir about her.    Vesemir plays a key role in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. He is the oldest living witcher, the only one to survive the pogrom which decimated the Wolf School witchers a long time ago. No one knows exactly how old Vesemir is, but it is possible that he is older than the very stones of Kaer Morhen, the keep where witchers of the Wolf School were trained, among which he once served as a fencing instructor. His gray hair frames the creased, craggy face of an old man, leaving no doubt that he is a veteran witcher, one whose skill could still give a younger man a run for his money.    Vesemir was the oldest living member of the Wolf School and most likely the oldest witcher of any school on the Continent. About as long in years as the ruins of Kaer Morhen themselves and eternally complaining about his creaky bones, this master of the witcher trade gave no thought to a well-deserved retirement. Gray, but still spry, he continued to ply the monster hunting trade into his golden years – effectively, too, as he'd seen more beasts than all his students put together. A harsh and demanding instructor in Geralt's youth, over the years he had become something of an adoptive father and mentor to the other witchers, always ready to help with sage advice and steady hands. In the spring of 1272, when our story begins, Vesemir had joined Geralt on his search for Yennefer, trekking with him through war-ravaged Temeria. Vesemir always said no witcher had ever died in his own bed, so death in combat surely awaited him as well. Death's waiting ended on the mournful day when the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen in pursuit of Ciri. Vesemir gave his all to protect his former ward, whom he had always treated like an adopted granddaughter, and died a hero's death at the hands of Imlerith, the Hunt's cruel general.    He appears in The Hexer TV series, but instead of a witcher he's depicted as a druid. He appears in 4 episodes: "Dzieciństwo", "Nauka", "Świątynia Melitele", and "Falwick".
