Kalten is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.    Royal Blood    Revolutions breed monsters, and Kalten was one beyond all doubt. Embodying the most primitive peasant desires, frustrations and fears, he was not bound by moral chains. Such people can commit acts most foul, and the list of this once simple farmer's atrocities was long indeed.
