Iron Mortimer was the captain of the Temple Guard and one of the fistfighters in Novigrad in 1272.    He's a tough, sinewy chap with a constitution to match his name, so more counters than usual are necessary. Timing and patience are required. Once you land a successful counter, make sure to follow with one or two quick jabs with a heavy punch before withdrawing before he can regain his composure.    Fists of Fury: Novigrad
