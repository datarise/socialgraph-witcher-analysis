Thirteen was a member of the elite Temerian special forces unit, the Blue Stripes. He enjoyed a good drink and arm wrestling.    Hung Over    Thirteen's name is likely a bit of a homage to the character Fifteen, one of Renfri's band, in the short story "The Lesser Evil". Thirteen has "13" tattooed on the right side of his neck. His body is missing from the tent where the Blue Stripes were hanged. Same goes for Fenn and Silas. It's unknown whether this was intended or an oversight.
