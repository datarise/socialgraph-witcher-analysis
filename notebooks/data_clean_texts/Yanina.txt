Yanina was an elderly woman in 1272 who lived near Honeyfill Meadworks in a small, isolated hut.    One day, her chickens started disappearing; in particular, only one would go missing each day. Her deceased husband, who'd been a poacher, had taught her how to read tracks and so she immediately believed it was a wolf, though it was rather odd that it was walking on its hind legs. However, when she spoke of this to others, they dismissed her claims. If Geralt investigates: Geralt tracked down the "monster" only to discover it was actually 3 clever, young orphans who were stealing to survive.  If Geralt convinces Yanina to take them in: on discovering they were children, Yanina took them in, where they kept her company and helped with the chores. If Geralt doesn't convince Yanina to take them in: true to their word, the children stole all the rest of Yanina's chickens, much to the elderly woman's dismay.    Empty Coop
