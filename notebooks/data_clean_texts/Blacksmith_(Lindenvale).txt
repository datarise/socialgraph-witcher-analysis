The Blacksmith in Lindenvale was an amateur blacksmith and avid Gwent player, using the Scoia'tael deck. He sells various notes for the School of Wolf and a map for School of Cat scavenger hunts. When Geralt asked him if he could craft master-quality weapons, he told him about Hattori of Novigrad which will trigger the respective quest.    He shares same face texture as Ambassador var Attre.
