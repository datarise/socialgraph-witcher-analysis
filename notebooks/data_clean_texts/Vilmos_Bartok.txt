Vilmos Bartok is the incense merchant in Flotsam. Vencel Pugg is extremely interested in the recipe for one particular blend of incense. Some Flotsam women are very suspicious about the true nature of the substances that Vilmos sells. Indeed it is quite odd that the incense causes hallucinations and is addictive. Vilmos Bartok also sells some alchemical ingredients (herbs and plants), crafting components and some recipes for potions and oils.
