Nadir is a named drowned dead known as "the Monster of the Lake", one of the two trophy-quests in Chapter I. His head is given to the Royal huntsman as a proof of slaying the monster in order to receive a reward. He can be found just beyond the old mill at night, along with a number of drowners. He only appears late at night.    Nadir does not spawn during the Strangers in the Night quest but will spawn before accepting the quest or after it has been completed and Geralt has spoken to Haren Brogg about it. Killing his entourage first is a good strategy.
