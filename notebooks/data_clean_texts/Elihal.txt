Elihal was an elven tailor who owned a workshop in the outskirts of Novigrad. Geralt met him on his search for Dandelion. He's described in Dandelion's Planner below:  A figure most rare, her nature dual.Look deep in her eyes, or be made a fool.    Geralt erroneously interpreted one of my notes to mean that Elihal and I had been a couple. Alas, while anyone would be thrilled to count this outstanding elf, wonderful conversation partner and superb tailor among their conquests, in fact no more than friendship and fine wine had ever passed between us. Geralt found this out when he visited Elihal's tailor shop, where he also got a first-hand glimpse at the elf's unusual hobby â€“ adopting the dress and mannerisms of those different from himself in race, sex and social status.    Elihal sells the following items:  Bird mask Elegant courtier's doublet (all versions) Elegant Nilfgaardian shoes Elegant Skellige shirt Harlequin mask Nilfgaardian trousers Shirt Skellige breeches (both versions) Skellige festive slippers Skellige tunic Wolf mask Triss' fox mask
