Rudolf de Jonkheer was a banker from a prominent family who lived in Novigrad for generations, stretching as far back as having helped laid the city's foundation, and culminating with Rudolf being in charge of the largest bank in the free city.    In 1272, Rudolf de Jonkheer purchased a house near the fish market of Novigrad. When he spent his first night in the house, he suspected it was haunted, as he heard giggling and furniture moving around, and even found feces in the parlor. As he paid a lot of money for the property, he wanted to know the house's history and to know if it was haunted, so he hired Corinne Tilly, a local oneiromancer, to dream the house's history. Geralt came through looking for Corinne and, seeing Geralt was a witcher, Rudolf let him into the house to solve whatever was going on inside. Soon after, Corinne left but didn't say anything to Rudolf, leaving him to question Geralt as the witcher also began to leave. If Geralt told him the house was haunted: Geralt told Rudolf that the house was haunted, and nobody could solve that issue. Rudolf was disappointed, as he paid a lot for the house. Sara and Corinne Tilly took up residence in the house and lived happily together. If Geralt tells the truth or forces Sarah to leave: Despite Geralt taking care of the haunting issue, Rudolf decided he had too much going on with the house and thus decided to sell it off. As agreed, he promised to reward Geralt a percentage of the commission once he sold the place.
