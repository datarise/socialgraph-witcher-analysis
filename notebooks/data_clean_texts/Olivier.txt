Olivier was the owner and innkeeper of The Kingfisher in Novigrad, having named it after one of Dandelion's ballads. He plays Gwent, using the Monsters deck, and the Tibor Eggebracht card can be obtained from him if beaten. He also sells the following cards:  Havekar Healer Havekar Smuggler Mahakaman Defender Vrihedd Brigade Veteran    If Geralt decides to help Anisse and Berthold, in the quest Now or Never, Olivier will be killed by the Witch hunters. He is then replaced by an unnamed innkeeper. If Olivier dies during Now or Never quest and the player didn't win his card yet, it can be found in the room near the counter, opposite the entrance to the cellar.
