Dune Vildenvert was a villager from White Orchard who lived on a farm with his family, just east of White Orchard village.    In early 1272, Dune managed to avoid being drafted into the Temerian Army by purposely injuring himself, unlike his brother Bastien. When Temerian and Nilfgaardian forces clashed on a battlefield during the Battle of White Orchard, Bastien went missing and Dune posted a notice on the White Orchard notice board, requesting help in finding his brother, as he wanted to find his brother alive or, at the very least, give his brother a proper burial. If Geralt helps him find his brother: they found Bastien along with a Nilfgaardian soldier, Rhosyn, and Bastien explained how both were wounded in the battle and helped each other to find shelter in a small hut in the woods. Dune, however, didn't want to take in the Nilfgaardian deserter.  If Geralt convinced him to take in Rhosyn: Dune was able to disguise the deserter and all of them tended to their family farm. If Geralt doesn't convince him to take in Rhosyn: Dune returned to his family farm with his brother, leaving the deserter to die in the abandoned hut. If Geralt found the brother before talking to Dune: Dune went and gathered his brother but, with nobody there to speak up for Rhosyn, he left the deserter to die.    Missing in Action    True to his words, Dune's in-game model does have some fingers missing on the left hand. The middle finger being the most noticeable.
