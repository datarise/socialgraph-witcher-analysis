Marquise Serenity was the madame at the Passiflora in Novigrad. She was also a gwent player, with Nilfgaard being her choice of deck, and will reward the Morvran Voorhis card if beaten.    Marquise Serenity worked at the Passiflora for many years, persevering with her job even after most of her friends had left to pursue other ventures. She recounted once meeting Geralt of Rivia and Dandelion when they arrived at the brothel with two halflings. In 1272, she had provided room and board at the Passiflora to Sigismund Dijkstra and his associates as they were plotting to assassinate King Radovid V. The madame settled Dijkstra on the top floor in one of the brothel's best suites, which was up a staircase hidden behind a secret door.    Certain dialogue options reveal that she is one of the few women in the Witcher's World to have served in an official capacity in a nation's military, with another example being Ves.
