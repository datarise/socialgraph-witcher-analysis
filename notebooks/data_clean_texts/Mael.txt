Mael is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He can be found in Vergen during chapter II. This quiet elf is a merchant and a Craftsman. His shop is situated on the left side of Rhundurin Square. Mael is also a dice player but he is not involved in any quests. You can ask him if you need to craft any kind of traps, swords or armor.    If "speech is silver, but silence is golden" then Mael must have been sufficiently rich to do something more interesting than run a shop. Nevertheless, the silent elf had some really interesting goods to offer.
