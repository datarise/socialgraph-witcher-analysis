Trygvi was one of inhabitants of Lofoten who survived the attack of the Wild Hunt in 1272. He and his wife both came out of the attack without sustaining any injuries, except mental trauma. He wanted to rake off the snow that Eredin and his men brought to the village from the roof of his house, but his wife told him to rather not do it, as it could bring some misfortune.
