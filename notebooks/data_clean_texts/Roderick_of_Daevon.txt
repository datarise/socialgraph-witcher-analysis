Roderick of Daevon is a minor character and a Elite Kaedweni Knight featured in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings during the Chapter II. He can be found in the tent near main gate to Kaedweni camp. He is likely from Daevon and belongs to Henselt's trusted knights, meaning he knows that king can be very touchy when it comes to his safety.    He does not believe that elves and humans can live in peace and also thinks that legend around Saskia is just propaganda of Aedirn.
