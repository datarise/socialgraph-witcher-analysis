Seherim is a secondary character in Chapter I of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He is one of the elves who live in Lobinden and can be found on the observation tower, often in the company of Cedric. He is tormented by the loss of his partner, Moril, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances nearly a year earlier. If Geralt sides with Vernon, he and Ves find Moril, heavily pregnant and being held prisoner by Bernard Loredo. During the rescue, Moril gives birth to a baby boy, but such is her despair that she commits suicide. Geralt then leaves the child in Seherim's care.
