Dea Strenger was the Bloody Baron's unborn daughter. After his wife Anna miscarried, she turned into a botchling. When Geralt of Rivia went to visit the Baron he came to the botchling's grave, unfilled and empty. He saw the botchling and had to make a choice. If Geralt spared the botchling: Geralt guided Phillip through an ancient naming ritual and Phillip named the stillborn Dea before burying her under the home's doorway. Later she turned into a lubberkin and helped him find the trails of Anna and their daughter Tamara. If Geralt killed the botchling: Phillip became upset at the witcher for killing his child once more, though nothing else could be done then.    Family Matters
