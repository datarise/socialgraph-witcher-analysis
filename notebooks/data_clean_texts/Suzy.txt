Suzy was a prostitute working at Crippled Kate's in Novigrad in 1272. If approached, she initially tried to be somewhat seductive, stating she was under a spell and asking if Geralt came there to kiss her to break it, but when asked to reveal anything about herself she refuses.    Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either Triss or Yennefer and will not affect any of the romance endings Geralt can receive.
