Glenna was a peasant who once settled in the village of Blackbough.    Glenna once lived in Novigrad with her husband who was a butcher there. Later, for unknown reasons, the pair relocated to the village of Blackbough in Velen. Though her husband was still known as a butcher, meat was incredibly scarce in Velen following the Nilfgaardian invasion of the region in the Third Nilfgaard War, and so the couple was forced to subsist on mostly selling other animal parts.    Wild at Heart    Geralt may speak to Glenna about Hanna's disappearance. Glenna believes that Hanna simply wandered off to the forest to pick mushrooms, and was presumably eaten by wolves. A conversation with Glenna cannot be started unless the quest objective to talk to her is active.
