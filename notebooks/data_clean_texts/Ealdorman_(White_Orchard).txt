The Ealdorman of White Orchard was once only a peasant and farmer but was later given the position of ealdorman of the small region. The villagers weren't bothered by this until Nilfgaardian army came.    Since the Nilfgaardian army came to White Orchard, the ealdorman had to discuss everything with them and their leader Peter Saar Gwynleve as the black army had taken over their region in 1272. While they didn't want to rely too much on the locals, they did require a percentage of their resources. After the ealdorman stated they could give a certain number of bushels of grain, Peter told him to give them a lesser amount. However, when the ealdorman returned, he gave them instead 30 bushels of rotten grain. To set an example, Peter then ordered the ealdorman to be punished by Nilfgaardian decree: fifteen lashes with a knout.    The ealdorman could also be seen at the local tavern, trying to learn Gwent from Aldert Geert. Aldert was upset that the Ealdorman does not seem to understand the rules of the game. Elsa tells you that the ealdorman used to put up contracts against the Griffin, but that he is not doing so anymore ever since the Nilfgaardian Army took over.
