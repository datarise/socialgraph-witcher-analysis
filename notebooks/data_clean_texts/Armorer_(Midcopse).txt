The armorer based in Midcopse is a gwent player and uses the Nilfgaardian Empire deck. When introducing himself, he advertised the Gabriel crossbow, which is contradictory as he did not sell this crossbow nor any weapons of his own. He sells Edwin Greloff's first and second maps as well as a variety of crafting diagrams.
