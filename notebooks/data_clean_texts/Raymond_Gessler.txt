Raymond Gessler is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He is a merchant and dice poker player who can be found in the camp followers' encampment during chapter II. With patch 1.3 installed, he also provides storage services.    The prophet Lebioda's wisdom, as recorded in the Good Book, was Raymond Gessler's recipe for life. This food peddler looked to the prophet's teachings at every step, following them even in pursuing his enterprise. This worked surprisingly well.
