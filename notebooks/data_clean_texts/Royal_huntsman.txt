The Royal Huntsman can be found throughout The Witcher. In particular, Geralt first meets him in the Outskirts, again in the Trade Quarter, and finally in a cave in the swamp cemetery. He's the primary source of information on hunts for exceptional monsters, paying a bounty for each trophy brought to him as proof of success. After the player turns in all 10 trophies they can talk to the Royal Huntsman again; he offers a choice between a steel sword and a silver sword. The steel sword is the Mahakaman Rune Sihil, and the silver sword is Moonblade.    During Chapter I he is located at his campsite, between the farming village and the crossroads near the Outskirts Inn. During Chapter II, Vincent Meis (captain of the City Guard) fulfills this function. During Chapter III, the Huntsman sits at a table in the Trade Quarter next to the Vizima cemetery gate (East of the Guardhouse), above The New Narakort. During Chapter IV, Tobias Hoffman (the chief of Murky Waters) fulfills this function. During Chapter V, the Huntsman is inside the Druids' cave in the swamp cemetery.
