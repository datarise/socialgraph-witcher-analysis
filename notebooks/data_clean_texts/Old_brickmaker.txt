The old brickmaker was one of the workers living in the village in the swamp near Vizima.    When he was just six years old, a brick fell on his head which made his speech somewhat defect. However, he could still provide a lot of information about the swamp. At some point between 1270 and 1272, he moved to a small village south of Byways in Velen and at times reminisced about brickworks near Vizima.
