Gaspard Sutter was a dwarf from Mahakam and a member of Rabenick and Company, a real estate appraisal business. He suffered from severe narcolepsy, and was constantly troubled by it.    In 1272, the company got stuck on the Isle of Mists, while travelling for business. Gaspard along with two others, Ivo and Ferenc, had set out in different directions in search for help or a way off the island when he ended up at the top of the lighthouse before falling asleep. Luckily Geralt arrived in his search for Ciri and found the sleeping dwarf. He then revealed to Geralt that he suffered from narcolepsy and that the witcher must wake him up repeatedly on the way back to the hut where his remaining comrades were. The two troubled up the cliffs towards the hut, along the way Gaspard kept falling asleep as they were being attacked by harpies. After reaching his friends, the dwarf left the two witchers and the company returned to the shoreline to prepare their boat.    Gaspard mentions Nibbles, a cat that shows up throughout The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions. Later, you can spot Gaspard and his friends trying to dig up a Place of Power stone in White Orchard forest.    Gaspard is a reference to Sleepy, a dwarf from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, who tends to fall asleep all the time.
