Stuttering Mattko was a horse racer outside Crow's Perch and, by his appearance, a mercenary. No matter what order you race him, he'll always give a racing saddle and 20  when beaten. He also appears to be the easiest to beat at Crow's Perch as he never has obstacles appear when racing him.    Races: Crow's Perch
