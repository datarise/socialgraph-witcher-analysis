Ilona was a merchant who could be found near Falas, her husband, outside of the Loc Muinne amphitheatre during Chapter III. She only sells food items. Although she did not initially have a beard when Geralt found her, he could get her to "grow it out". This was virtually instantaneous.    A bearded elven woman is an exceptional sight, even if the beard is false. When there were no crowds, Ilona made ends meet by running a food shop.
