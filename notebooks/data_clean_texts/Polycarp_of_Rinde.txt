Polycarp of Rinde was a half-brother of the Order of the Flaming Rose in 1271. He served the Order as the master at arms.    Apparently, Polycarp hailed from the city of Rinde in southern Redania. In July 1271, when King Radovid V invited several Order Knights to Loc Muinne to act as a police force ensuring peaceful negotiations, Polycarp of Rinde was among them, accompanying Grandmaster Siegfried of Denesle.    Despite the favors Geralt had done the Order, half-brother Polycarp of Rinde, the master at arms, was not exceptionally cordial. It was also difficult to convince him to allow the witcher to use the stock of the Order's armory.
