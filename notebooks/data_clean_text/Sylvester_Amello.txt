Sylvester Amello was a merchant in Novigrad in 1272. At that time, he was troubled by a so-called "Imp" whom the merchant posted a contract on after it stole from his stall. Eventually, Geralt of Rivia responded to the notice, and Sylvester bade him to deal with the imp problem. If Geralt brought him the Imp's head, Sylvester paid the witcher the agreed upon amount; otherwise, he only paid half.    Contract: An Elusive Thief    Though Sylvester is a merchant, it is not possible to trade with him. There is, however, a merchant in the same square whom it's possible to trade with.
