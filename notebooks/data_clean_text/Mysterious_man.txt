The mysterious man is someone who can be found lurking outside Thaler's place in the Temple Quarter at night. Sometimes, he can actually be found inside Thaler's house.    Suspect: Thaler    The Mysterious man retires to what seems to be his home around midnight, a house which is to the right of the hospital. He enters through a door Geralt can not open. He also pees sometimes at the side of the abandoned house (with no door) just right next to Thaler's door.
