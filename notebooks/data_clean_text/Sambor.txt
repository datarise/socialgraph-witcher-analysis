Sambor was a merchant, dice poker player, and (with patch 1.2 installed) barber who can be found in the camp followers' encampment during chapter II.    The saying "No sweets without sweat" was certainly true in Sambor's case. This trader with a proverb for every occasion ran a thriving pawn shop, selling interesting scrolls, books and manuscripts among other items. Geralt was surprised to learn that Sambor was also a skillful barber. For a fistful or orens, the trader could work wonders with the witcher's mane.
