Boussy La Valette was the son of Mary Louisa La Valette and brother of Anaïs. Who his father was is not known for sure. Officially, it was the Old Baron La Valette, but many rumors persist that he and his sister were actually King Foltest of Temeria's progeny. If this is true, then both he and his sister were in line for the Temerian throne. In Chapter II, if Geralt chose Roche's path, he learned that Boussy was accidentally killed in the attempt to kidnap the siblings, leaving his sister, Anaïs, the sole heir to the throne.    No more than a lad back then, Boussy already displayed the pride and obstinacy typical of the La Valettes. Some, however, attributed these qualities to the fact that King Foltest was his father. The boy had died in mysterious circumstances, but the significance of this event was clear. Of Baroness La Valette's and King Foltest's two children, only Anaïs remained alive – a young girl born out of wedlock, the sole and highly problematic heir to the Temerian throne. As Geralt was sailing up the Pontar, Boussy was packed up and placed in a convoy that was to take him to Loc Muinne. The boy never reached the city.
