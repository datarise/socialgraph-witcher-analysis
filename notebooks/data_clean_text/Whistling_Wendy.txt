Whistling Wendy was a Kaedweni prostitute. She first worked in Kaedweni Army but later moved to Novigrad.    In June of 1271, Whistling Wendy was one of the girls working for Madame Carole at the Kaedweni brothel and was considered the most beautiful of her kind by Henselt's soldiers. A year later she had moved on to working on the street corners of Novigrad, but this time on her own. When Priscilla was viciously attacked, she tried to help avenge the trobairitz as Priscilla had always treated her like an equal rather than look down on her like so many others. Going by the belief that attackers tended to return to the scene of the crime, she waited in the alley where Priscilla was attacked with some thugs when Geralt, who was also investigating into the attack, came along. After a quick fight, Wendy realized the witcher was also trying to help and apologized before letting Geralt continue his investigation.       Conspiracy Theory       Carnal Sins
