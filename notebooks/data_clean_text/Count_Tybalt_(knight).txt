Count Tybalt was a Knight of the Flaming Rose. If you chose Roche's path, Geralt can find him sitting on the right side of the King Henselt's tent at the Kaedweni camp during Chapter II. If you sided with the Order in The Witcher and imported a save into The Witcher 2, he will reward you with a steel plate enhancement for your aid. If you killed Siegfried of Denesle in the original game, he attacks you.    There is a bug where if you imported a neutral path saved game from The Witcher but did not kill Siegfried, Tybalt still attacks you saying you did kill Siegfried.
