Einar, son of Toradar, is a pirate living in Larvik. He was a member of the Terror Crew, a pirate crew lead by the infamous pirate Morkvarg. Einar was present during Morkvarg's ransacking of Freya's Garden. It was commonly assumed that Priestess Ulve had cursed Morkvarg before he had killer her, but it was in fact Einar who had placed the curse on him. Disgusted with the atrocities Morkvarg committed against the gods by defiling the garden, he transformed Morkvarg into a Werewolf using a cursed pendant given to him by his father.
