Fence is an informal term for a person who receives and disposes of stolen goods. In The Witcher, at least two people present themselves as fences: Thaler, who, as it turns out, is not actually a fence, and a tough-looking fellow in Old Vizima in Chapter V. The man in Chapter V is a fence, he is not simply effecting a cover for investigative purposes. He buys and sells pretty much anything from his location in the dark alley, west of the field hospital (other looters and various individuals also mill about there). It is possible that he is only available when Geralt first reaches Old Vizima and that he is no longer available later in Chapter V.  books: Diary of a Dice Collector The Aftermath of the War Elder Blood one of each kind of meteorite ore one of each kind of rune diamond dust jewelry alcohol a torch and flint    Thaler: Though not really, it is just a cover.
