Petter was a Skelliger who in 1272, fell off the Grymmdjarr Monument when he tried to light the braziers on top. He broke his leg and his friend Ulf didn't know how to help, though was chastising Petter for complaining about breaking his leg. If Geralt passes by, he can choose to help, by giving Petter a little bit of Celandine, a herb which wouldn't fix his leg but it wouldn't hurt as much.    Brave Fools Die Young
