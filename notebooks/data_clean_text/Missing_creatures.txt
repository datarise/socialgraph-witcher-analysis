During the making of The Witcher and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there were several characters and creatures that did not make the final cut, but which might possibly appear in future sequels.       Bogut Kuternoga, who seems to be the basic "fence" sketch. The sources of the items he sells including weapons, armor and jewelry are very suspicious. He would have wandered the streets of Vizima having no fixed address. "Kuternoga" translates to "lame duck". Boholt Kristina, who appears to be some sort of female warrior. Maggot, or the "Beggar King", originally conceived as one of the "most respected" beggars in Vizima. He is extremely smart and crafty, and most importantly, knows almost all the inhabitants of the city. Halfar and Franz Kniprode, two characters that appeared only in 2004 E3 demo of the game and were replaced.    Corpus Custodia Warg Wererat Zombie    see The Witcher 3 cut content
