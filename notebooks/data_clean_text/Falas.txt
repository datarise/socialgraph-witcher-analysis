Falas was a merchant, craftsman, and dice poker player who can be found near Ilona, his wife, outside of the Loc Muinne amphitheatre during Chapter III. He told Geralt of how he was once a good swordsmith, or at least it looked like he might be, but a riot came through town taking his workshop with it and leaving him with nothing but his skills. He also professed to prefer swallowing swords to hammering them, but that upset his wife.    In business, the ability to adapt one's skills is half the battle. After losing his workshop, the former elven sword smith Falas earned his living as a sword swallower. And thought clients were few, Falas still provided reliable services in his former profession.
