Dagonet and his friend Harmond were court jesters and brought along as entertainment when King Demavend III of Aedirn decided to sail on the Pontar in 1271. Unfortunately for them, Letho chose that day to assassinate the king and threw a magical capsule that froze everyone and thing that wasn't protected from it. Dagonet was caught in the blast and subsequently shattered when the ship began to break apart.    The two jesters display truly clownish humor. Their coarse, at times even vulgar situational comedy was meant as a foil to the monarch's majestic presence. Though this is achieved, they simultaneously underline the king's evidently plebeian tastes. The ruler finds their bumbling funny â€“ as most probably many people in the Middle Ages would.
