Vespula was one of the many young women who Dandelion briefly fancied while in Novigrad.    Sometime in the 1260s, she and Dandelion had been in a relationship, but as was typical of the bard, he was caught running after other women. Angry at this behavior, Vespula started yelling at the bard while throwing everything out her window at him, including his lute, but Dandelion was able to catch it. Later on, while Geralt, Dandelion, and Dainty were trying to catch Dudu, a doppler that'd been impersonating the latter, she appeared in the same market the trio were searching. Dandelion, who felt he wouldn't do much good for the group, began to give a small show at one of the stalls and Vespula, armed with a frying pan, tried to make her way over to him to hit him upside the head, but he and the others scattered. A short time later, she spotted Dandelion once more in the same market and, catching him unawares, hit him on the head with the frying pan, knocking him out. However, she'd actually hit Dudu, who'd taken on Dandelion's image, and the doppler began to change to his natural form. Shocked at what she was seeing, Vespula screamed and ran off.     In 1272 she worked in a laundry in the Farcorners district of Novigrad and Dandelion convinced her to take him back. However, after spending a week asking her questions about her job at Sigismund's Bathhouse and about the other washer women, she saw him at the harbor with a blonde woman and promptly threw the bard out once more. Dandelion described her in his planner:  Though timid in looks, no adventure did skip her.My heart melts when she asks, "Ever had a Big Dipper?"    Broken Flowers
