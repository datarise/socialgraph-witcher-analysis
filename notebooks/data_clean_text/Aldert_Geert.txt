Aldert Geert was an Oxenfurt scholar and an assistant professor of Contemporary History at Oxenfurt Academy. He was a gwent player, using the Nilfgaardian Empire deck and, if beaten, gives the Zoltan Chivay gwent card.    In May 1272, Aldert was passing through White Orchard, eager to reach the front lines of the Third Northern War, in order to describe and catalogue it in what he hoped would be his magnum opus. While in the small, war-torn village, he dropped into the local inn at the same time as the witchers Geralt and Vesemir and attempted to teach some locals how to play gwent, though both parties got more frustrated than anything else. If Geralt approaches him: trying to obtain information about Yennefer, Geralt asked Aldert about her, but he believed that she didn't exist. Before the witcher left, he asked whether he wanted a game of gwent. If Geralt agrees to a game: Geralt played his first ever game of gwent, and if he won, he was rewarded a gwent card and a book.    Shortly after, in his misguided attempt to be in the middle of the action, Aldert was caught and hanged from Hanged Man's Tree in Velen by an unknown faction.    Lilac and Gooseberries    Beneath his body you can find his unfinished book and the Zoltan card if you didn't beat or talk to him in White Orchard. Geralt can try to discourage Aldert from visiting the front lines, stating that the scholar would be killed for boots. Indeed, his body is one of the two lacking boots when found hanged. If you play him at gwent, after the match has finished, he will recommend that if you are in Oxenfurt, play the innkeep Stjepan, which will activate the quest Gwent: Playing Innkeeps. Speaking to Aldert is completely optional, as speaking to Gaunter O'Dimm is the only patron required to speak to Geralt to advance the quest.
