Vairmont Jonne or Gustavo was a professor from the Faculty of Applied Archeology at Oxenfurt Academy.    In 1272, he happened across a map that was said to lead to the Dar'Ah Manuscript, a supposedly priceless elven tome that could give valuable insight into the Aen Seidhe's history. The map led him to the elven ruins beneath Novigrad but he was unable to search for it as a sarcophagus in the ruins was sealed up tight.

If Geralt checks it again: now angry at being woken up again, the vampire attacked the men, leaving Geralt no choice but to kill it.
