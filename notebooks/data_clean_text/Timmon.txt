Timmon was a Skelliger living in Harviken on Faroe Isle in 1272. He was engaged to Agda and they were to be married once she arrived in Harviken.    While he prepared for his wedding, his brothers, Ulf and Mikkel, were sent to pick up Agda and bring her to Faroe. Unfortunately, a storm hit during their trip back and Agda drowned. Rather than face Timmon over their disgrace at failing to protect Agda, his brothers then committed suicide to maintain their honor.    The Price of Honor    If Geralt finds out what happened and let Timmon know, Timmon will later set up an altar at the crashed site.
