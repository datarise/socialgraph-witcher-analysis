The armorer in Hierarch Square operated out of a small store in an alcove located on the square's west side.    Despite being an armorer, his standard greeting is "top notch swords!"    It is possible that the armorer may be absent from his shop during working hours. Meditating for some amount of time may cause him to return. Note that this is a persistent bug that affects several armorers and blacksmiths in the game.
