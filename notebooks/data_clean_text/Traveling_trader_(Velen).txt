Throughout Velen there are several constantly traveling traders.    This trader sells mostly alchemy ingredients and can be found wandering the roads around Velen in the following areas:  along the road starting at the crossroads area south of Drahim Castle and east along the roads then north to the hut southeast of Cunny of the Goose from the eastern gate of Stonecutters' Settlement and up the road to a point on the road almost exactly east of Codgers' Quarry signpost    This trader also sells mostly alchemy ingredients and can be found wandering on the western side of Grassy Knoll, from a small campfire just west of Lucian's Windmill and follows the road northeast to Farcorners, then north to Portside Gate and east about halfway to Glory Gate before turning back around.    Unlike many of the other merchants, the traders' model varies throughout a single game, likely to make them appear as several different merchants rather than just one.
