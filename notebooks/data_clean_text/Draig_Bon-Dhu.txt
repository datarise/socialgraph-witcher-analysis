Draig Bon-Dhu was a young skald from Skellige who accompanied Eist Tuirseach, Crach an Craite, and Mousesack to the feast held by Queen Calanthe in honour of her daughter, the Princess Pavetta's coming of age. He was described as "a strapping fellow with bagpipes".    He appeared only briefly at Kaer Trolde, where he performed a ballad about Hjalmar slaying the giant on Undvik. Later on he was among the victims of the Berserker attack.    King's Gambit    In A Question of Price he played the bagpipes while in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt he plays a lute. He does not have a unique model, therefore it is possible to see "him" playing at the Coronation among other skalds.        See the GWENT standalone game version card: Draig Bon-Dhu
