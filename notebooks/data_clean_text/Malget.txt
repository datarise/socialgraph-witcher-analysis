Malget was Mavrick's father and reportedly a folk healer. He is only mentioned in the game and does not actually appear. Mavrick tells his tale which was that three years prior to the events in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, while he was tending to those wounded in a battle, some soldiers raped his daughters. This drove him mad and he killed the girls and buried them behind his hut, only to be discovered by his son upon his return from a scouting mission. The two men fought and Malget fell from the cliff. Also, it is mentioned that he had spent some time dealing with a demon, which caused the return of said demon as a bunch of wraiths in order to haunt Mavrick.    Little Sisters
