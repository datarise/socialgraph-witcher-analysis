Hammond was a slaver and former member of Jad Karadin's gang, along with Selyse, Lund and Vienne. He was considered to be Karadin's right-hand man.    As a member of Jad Karadin's gang he was one of the people responsible for the death of the witcher Aiden of the Cat School. After the gang disbanded, Hammond travelled to Skellige and started a slave trade business in Trottheim. He built his reputation as the chief pirate of Faroe, commanding a mighty fleet, gaining bounties in every island of Skellige and the respect of the jarls.
