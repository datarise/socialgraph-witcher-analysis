Enzo Etcheverry is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.    The Temerian count signed a friendship-agreement with King Foltest, before joining the rebellion on the side of Maria Louisa La Valette, ultimately dying on the walls of her castle.    If Geralt manages to shoot him with a ballista bolt: Before he got entangled in the revolt against Foltest, Sir Etcheverry was known for his valor and tenacity as a knight, proving both in more than one tournament, either mounted or on foot. Yet valiance and tenacity meant nothing in the face of a ballista bolt, and thus the brave Etcheverry paid with his life for his ill-advised participation in the rebellion. If Geralt does not manage to shoot him with a ballista bolt: Before he got entangled in the revolt against Foltest, Sir Etcheverry was known for his valor and tenacity as a knight, proving both in more than one tournament, either mounted or on foot. Yet valiance and tenacity were not enough to survive a cut from the witcher's blade, and thus the brave Etcheverry paid with his life for his ill-advised participation in the rebellion.    In order to successfully complete the achievement, Eagle Eye, you must aim dead center at the soldier on the right, as opposed to aiming directly at Count Etcheverry. If you miss Etcheverry with the first ballista, then you encounter him later after destroying the gate with the ballista in the courtyard. He then drops a Fibre enhancer.
