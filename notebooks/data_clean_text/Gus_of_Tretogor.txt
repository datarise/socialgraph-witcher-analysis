Gus of Tretogor was a mage and close colleague of Carduin with whom he was trying to reactivate Council and Conclave to its former glory on the summit at Loc Muinne in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He thought that John Natalis would be a challenge to convince as he was too honest. But the only thing he feared was that those mages that did not come to debates, like Francesca, Ida and Yennefer, would be the first to criticise.    Gus is English form of Latin name Augustus meaning majestic.
