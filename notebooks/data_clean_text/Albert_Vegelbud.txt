Albert Vegelbud was an amateur alchemist from the Novigrad region and part of the wealthy Vegelbud family.    After Loc Muinne's events and King Radovid V's witch hunts, Albert became a target for his dabbling in alchemy. His mother, Ingrid Vegelbud, used the family's wealth and influence to pay off the city guards to not tell the witch hunters about her son, but somehow they still found out and planned to attack him on his family's own estate. If Geralt helps Triss get Albert out of Novigrad: with Geralt's help, Albert was safely evacuated from his family's estate during a masquerade ball. When other hiding mages fled Novigrad, he went with them to Kovir, a known safe haven for magic users.    A Matter of Life and Death
