John Verdun was a former soldier in the Temerian Army, having served in the 10th Maribor division before 1272, but deserted before it was destroyed by the Nilfgaardians during their invasion of the North. He fell in with a group of fleeing refugees but, when they learned he had deserted, the refugees tied him up and left him for drowners on the river bank west of Mulbrydale. If Geralt leaves him there: John insinuated there was more to the story than just being a deserter but refused to elaborate. Not trustful of this, Geralt left him there and John was summarily killed by drowners a short time later. If Geralt frees him: John thanked the witcher and headed off. Later on, he gathered some men and hunted down and killed the refugees that left him on the river bank. When he spied the witcher crossing his path again, he welcomed Geralt and offered to pay him for saving his life earlier, despite it being obvious he'd killed the refugees at the camp.  If Geralt takes the reward: Not seeing the point in questioning it further, Geralt accepted John's payment and they went their separate ways. If Geralt fights him: Not wanting to let it go that John had killed all the refugees, Geralt and John fought, unfortunately ending in John's death.    At the Mercy of Strangers    While not a main plot driver, this quest and character serve as a warning example of the unintended side effects of the witcher's actions.
