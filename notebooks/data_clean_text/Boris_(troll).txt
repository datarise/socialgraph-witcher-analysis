Boris was a rock troll living in Mudplough, Velen in 1272. The area was also teeming with nekkers and so the troll put to good use one his favored recipes, nekker soup, which the ogroids didn't take to very well and started to attack the rock troll in retaliation. If Geralt intervenes: deciding to help the outnumbered rock troll, Geralt killed off the attacking nekkers, for which Boris was grateful and gave the witcher a reward. After explaining he was cooking nekker soup, the witcher then told the troll to refrain from cooking any more of them to prevent future attacks.    Harassing a Troll
