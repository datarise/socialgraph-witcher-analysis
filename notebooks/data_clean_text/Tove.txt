Tove was a Skelliger who lived around Kaer Trolde Harbor in 1272. She'd once been married and had a son, but her husband was attacked one night out on the cliffs while trying to find their son, who'd sadly met the same fate, dying at the hands of a strong water hag, Abaya.    Contract: Muire D'yaeblen    In-game, the floating text only names her as "Skellige Woman". Tove's head scarf is a traditional Scottish "tartan" belonging to the MacArthur clan.
