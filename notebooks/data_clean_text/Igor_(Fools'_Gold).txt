Igor was the local herbalist of Lurtch, until 1272, when he was transformed into a pig.    He and the other villagers, save Yontek, robbed from a nearby altar, not realizing it was cursed. Shortly thereafter all the villagers turned into pigs and somehow Igor got left behind at the altar location, now in pig form. If Geralt visited the "Hog Hut": the witcher found Igor and proceeded to have a "conversation" with him in the form of oinking a number of times for yes or no. After this, Geralt could then help lift the curse, transforming Igor back to human form.    Fools' Gold
