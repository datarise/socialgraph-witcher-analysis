Ivar was a Skelliger who, unlike most of the other islanders, didn't worship Freya, or any religion for that matter.    In 1272, he was in love with a Freya priestess, Irma, and wished to marry her and while she also showed interested in Ivar, her religion forbade them from being together. Ever persistent, he decided he was going to learn and read all he could about different religions as he was bound to find a loophole that'd let them get married. At one point he ended up on Snidhall Isle and where Irma's irate brother tracked him down, mad that Ivar dared to lead his sister away from being a priestess.  If Geralt intervenes: Ivar was saved by the witcher and, knowing Geralt traveled quite a bit, asked him to bring back any books on religion so he could learn more. If Geralt gathers all the books for him: Ivar thanked the witcher for all his help and decided it was time to branch out to learn more from the world so he could one day be with Irma. He then went to Novigrad as the city was brimming with culture and signed on with a ship to earn a living while he soaked in all the knowledge. If Geralt doesn't intervene: Ivar unfortunately met his end on the isle.    Free Spirit
