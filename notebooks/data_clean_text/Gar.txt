Gar (Polish: Niszczuka) was one of the Crinfrid Reavers, a group of mercenaries hired by King Niedamir to take part in the hunt for a Myrgtabrakke, dragon outside Barefield. He was older than Kennet but younger than Boholt. He had a preference for wielding a large two-handed sword. He fought alongside Kennet and Boholt, their leader. Sometime around 1271, he and Kennet took the first apprentice, Newboy. A few years afterward, the Reavers grew in numbers with Gar, Boholt, Kennet and, to some extent, Newboy remembered as legends.
