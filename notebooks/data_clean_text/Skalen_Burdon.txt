Skalen Burdon is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He is a dice poker player and arm wrestler. He can be found in Vergen during Chapter II. Saskia describes him as "a gambler, an addict, and perhaps Vergen's top sharp". For Death Symbolized, Geralt must beat Skalen at poker to retrieve Sabrina's spear.    Bring it on: Vergen Death Symbolized Poker Face: Vergen The Spear of Destiny    Cecil's nephew, the young Skalen Burdon, had been taken in by the alderman after the lad's parents perished in one of the nonhuman massacres that occured in Aedirn. As friendly, hard working and efficient as his uncle, Skalen took it upon himself to act as Vergen's official representative in his uncle's absence, providing all newcomers to the town with any information or assistance they needed.    If Geralt beats him twice more at dice poker, Skalen will first reward the witcher with the "the sword of the warrior princess Xenthia" and then the Dun Banner cloak, which can be used in the quest "Death Symbolized". Prior to version 2.0, a rusty steel sword would be received instead of the Princess Xenthia sword. On the Xbox 360 you still only receive a Rusty steel sword. If you lose to him, trying to win off the Iorveth's Spearhead for the quest, he will say that you "Lost like that pal Blaskowitz, who was searching for some old spear of Fate or whatnot". This is an easter egg, a reference to Wolfenstein protagonist, "B.J."_Blazkowicz William Blaskowicz.
