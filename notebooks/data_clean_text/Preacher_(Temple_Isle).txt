This preacher is also an alchemist, though he has to hide this fact to protect himself, making him a rather reluctant priest of the Eternal Fire. He can be found at the Electors' Square in Novigrad during the day and sells a variety of crafting diagrams and alchemical supplies. He will also play gwent though he doesn't give any special cards.    Free Spirit
