This barber lived in a shop in the eastern part of The Bits, the poorest district of Novigrad. He only charged 5  for cutting Geralt's beard or hair, but is permanently drunk, so you better look for another barber.    He has a small chance of giving a different haircut from the one you asked. The first time this happens, Geralt will openly protest against his behavior, with the barber responding in lack of care for his opinion.
