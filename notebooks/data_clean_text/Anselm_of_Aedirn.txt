Anselm of Aedirn was a noble knight and Aedirnian royal guard (along with Himsbach) in 1271 who tried to shield his king, Demavend III, from Letho. He died trying to defend him, along with Himsbach, Tybalt, and Abelard.    Though in the scene as a whole these royal guards are mere background figures, they are as detailed as any primary character. Both men-at-arms wear chainmail and breastplates, which meant their clothing needed to be animated differently than that of the other fight participants. Due to the effort we put into creating them, we decided these initially nameless defenders of the king deserved mention.
