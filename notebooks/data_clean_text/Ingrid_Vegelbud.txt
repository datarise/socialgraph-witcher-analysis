In her earlier life, Ingrid travelled frequently to the city of Brugge, as her father owned an estate their; and she would spent her time riding horses. In 1272, Lady Vegelbud's estate was graced by the arrival of Geralt of Rivia, who warned that a serial killer was targeting her mother. Though skeptical, Ingrid nonetheless agreed to check on Patricia. When they reached Patricia's bedroom, Ingrid assumed from the closed door that all was well, though Geralt insisted that she go inside. Upon opening the door, Ingrid saw her mother dead, stripped naked and cuffed to the bed as the killer fled. Geralt gave chase but the confusion among the guards led them to mistake him for the culprit, resulting in the witcher being detained and allowing the real killer to escape. Ingrid rebuked her guard for his ineptitude, who released Geralt. Geralt then requested to inspect her mother's body, as the killer usually left a note on the body. Ingrid granted him permission and left him alone, not wanting to see her mother in that state. Later Ingrid requested Triss Merigold's aid in smuggling her son Albert from her estate past the witch hunters in exchange for her support in helping the mages escape Novigrad.
