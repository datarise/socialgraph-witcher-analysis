'''Egill''' aka the "Taciturn Druid" was a [[druid]] who lived in a grotto under the sacred tree [[Gedyneith]] on [[Ard Skellig]]. By {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} he hadn't spoken in three years as he'd taken a vow of silence.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt "cures" him}} [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], tricked into thinking it wasn't selective mutism, did all he could to scare or irritate the druid until, out of anger, Egill yelled at the [[witcher]] before stopping mid-sentence, realizing he'd broken his vow. He then told Geralt and the trickster off.
