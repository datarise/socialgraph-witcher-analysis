'''Fence''' is an informal term for a person who receives and disposes of stolen goods. In {{Tw1}}, at least two people present themselves as fences: [[Thaler (spy)|Thaler]], who, as it turns out, is not actually a fence, and a tough-looking fellow in [[Old Vizima]] in Chapter V. The man in Chapter V ''is'' a fence, he is not simply effecting a cover for investigative purposes.

He buys and sells pretty much anything from his location in the [[dark alley]], west of the [[field hospital]] (other looters and various individuals also mill about there). It is possible that he is only available when Geralt first reaches Old Vizima and that he is no longer available later in Chapter V.
