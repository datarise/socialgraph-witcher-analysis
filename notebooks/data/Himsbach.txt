'''Himsbach''' was a noble knight and [[Aedirn]]ian royal guard (along with [[Anselm of Aedirn|Anselm]]) in {{Year|canon=no|year=1271}} who tried to shield his king, [[Demavend III]], from [[Letho]]. He died trying to defend him, along with Anselm, [[Tybalt of Vengerberg|Tybalt]], and [[Abelard of Hagge|Abelard]].

== ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Artbook|The Witcher 2 Digital Artbook]]'' description ==
:''Though in the scene as a whole these royal guards are mere background figures, they are as detailed as any primary character. Both men-at-arms wear chainmail and breastplates, which meant their clothing needed to be animated differently than that of the other fight participants. Due to the effort we put into creating them, we decided these initially nameless defenders of the king deserved mention.''
