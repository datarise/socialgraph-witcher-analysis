|Appears_games = {{Tw3}}}}'''Vernossiel''' was the commander of a small [[Scoia'tael]] faction in [[Velen]] that was attacking [[Redania]]n army supply transports during the [[Third Northern War]], reasoning that it wasn't civilians they were killing but soldiers who killed, tortured, and raped their fellow brethren.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt kills her}} she met her end in Velen, when Geralt killed her and her small band.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt lets her be but then tells [[Felix Grubb]] about them}} presumably her group was attacked by Redanian soldiers though she managed to escape. Knowing Geralt was the only one to know about them, she later tried to ambush the [[witcher]] near [[Novigrad]], resulting in her death.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt lets her group be}} she continued to attack supply caravans with her group.
