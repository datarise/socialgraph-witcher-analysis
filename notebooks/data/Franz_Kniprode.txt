'''Franz Kniprode''' was a [[Temeria]]n [[mage]], or more precisely, a [[Necromancy|necromancer]] able to summon [[zombie]]s who resided for time near the [[Old manor house|Old Castle]]. He appeared only in a 2004 video of {{Tw1}} video game, and not in the final cut, although a model similar to his was later used for [[Everden of Rinde]] in the ''[[Side Effects]]'' add-on.

== Story ==
In the demo, Kniprode asked [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] for help in getting the skull of [[Foltest]]'s grandfather, because there was something in the skull that would help revive his dead wife. The [[witcher]] then went to the catacombs where he ran into [[Halfar]] and his thugs, and was faced with a decision. He could either kill them or send them away, before killing a [[koshchey]] and getting back to Franz.
