'''Abigail''' was a [[witch]] who lived in her [[Abigail's house|house]] in the [[outskirts]] of [[Vizima]]. She was not well-liked by the villagers and got blamed for many bad or strange occurrences. Her main skill was [[The Witcher alchemy|alchemy]], so though the villagers approached her with suspicion, they also relied on her for potions and poisons - which she provided, rarely bothering with questions or moral objections.

In the course of Chapter I, Abigail took in the orphaned [[Alvin]] after [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] saved him from the [[barghest]]s as [[Shani]] could not care for him from an [[Outskirts Inn|inn]]. She also facilitated a trance where the boy revealed more about [[Hellhound|the beast]] and its minions who were plaguing the village.

Geralt can buy a [[Specter Oil|blade coating]] formula from her that makes it easier to battle specters and ghosts. In fact, she buys and sells quite a few things:
* the aforementioned [[Specter oil|Specter Oil]]
* some [[The Witcher ingredients|ingredients]] in particular [[Phosphorus]], the only source of [[Vermilion]] in Chapter I
* some [[blade coating bases|greases]] (bear fat)
* [[Bomb making bases|bomb making]] ingredients
* a few books
** [[The Book of Animals]]
** [[Barghests]]
** [[Field Plants]]
** [[Swamp Monsters]]
* an [[Red ribbon|anti-drowner talisman]]
* [[Barghest skull]]s (she will buy these as well as the [[pouch of salt]])
* [[Wolf pelt]]s
* [[Basilisk hide]]s
* [[Fleder fang]]s
If her fate was left to the villagers, she cursed Geralt in the name of the [[Coram Agh Tera|Lionhead Spider]], which she called the Black Legba. Whether this meant she was also responsible for the misdeeds of the other villagers is unclear.

== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ==
:''"A witch named Abigail lives in a village in the Outskirts. Though the villagers buy herbs and potions from her, she also faces much hostility."''
:'''if Geralt saves Abigail from the mob''':
::''The Reverend informed the congregation that Abigail had uttered the Curse of the Hellhound and the witch was surrounded by an angry mob. I decided that she did not deserve to die, and saved her from being lynched. Abigail left the Outskirts for good.''
::''I met Abigail again in the village of [[Murky Waters]]. The witch still trades in herbs and potions.''
:'''if Geralt leaves Abigail to be lynched''':
::''The Reverend informed the congregation that Abigail had uttered the Curse of the Hellhound and the witch was surrounded by an angry mob. I decided not to interfere in the shadowy internal affairs of the Outskirts. The witch was burned at the stake just after I left.''
== Notes ==
* Abigail took Alvin under her wing after the demise of his foster mother, [[Caroline]].
* Abigail is in possession of [[Berengar's notes on the Beast]].
* A vial of Specter Oil can be looted from her corpse on the occasion of her death.
* If Abigail is spared at the end of [[Chapters|Chapter I]], she will take [[Murky Waters healer|the healer]]'s place in [[Chapters|Chapter IV]], just outside of the inn.
* If Abigail was lynched, The Heat of the Day quest will play out differently.
* If Abigail was lynched, the healer in Chapter IV tells Geralt that he shed innocent blood (Abigail) by not saving her.
* In {{BoF}}, the speech made by the local priest is virtually identical to the speech delivered by the [[Reverend]] in the Outskirts when the villagers try to lynch Abigail.
