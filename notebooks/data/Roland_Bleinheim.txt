It is his men who kidnapped innocent brickmakers and forced them to gather [[Beggartick blossoms|beggartick]] for the [[fisstech]] labs. [[Vaska]] described him as ''"an evil man"'' and specifically asked Geralt to kill him. His [[Gellert Bleinheim|brother]] (apparently) ran a similar operation in the [[Vizima sewers|sewers]] of Vizima.
