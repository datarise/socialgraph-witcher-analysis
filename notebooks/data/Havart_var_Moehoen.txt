'''Havart var Moehoen''' served in the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] army as [[Field marshal]] after the death of [[Menno Coehoorn]]. He was in a position of confidence with [[Emperor]] [[Emhyr var Emreis]], and so was granted governorship over [[Temeria]].

We can see him for the first time and only time when we come to [[Crow's Perch]] in [[Velen]], where he is making deal with the [[Phillip Strenger|Bloody Baron]] but leaves when [[Geralt of Rivia]] arrives. After this he is not shown anymore, only mentioned in a [[Nilfgaardian demands|letter]].
