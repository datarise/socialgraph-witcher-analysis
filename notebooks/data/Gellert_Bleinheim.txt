'''Gellert Bleinheim''' is the "drug lord" heading up the [[fisstech]] production operation for [[Salamandra]] in the [[Vizima sewers|Sewers]] beneath [[Vizima Temple Quarter|Vizima's Temple Quarter]] ([[Chapters|Chapter III]]). The [[Salamandra hideout in the sewers|Fisstech lab]] is guarded by two thugs who ask [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] for a [[password]] in order to enter. Geralt can tell them that "'''thorn'''" is the password and enter peacefully or he may opt to [[The Witcher fistfighting|fistfight]] them and gain entrance that way.

After clearing the Fisstech lab, Gellert Bleinheim and his thugs are found at the Southmost part of the Sewers (where the tunnels form a "Y" on the map). He carries the [[Key to Salamandra code]], which is used to decipher the [[Encrypted document]] found in the Fisstech lab.
