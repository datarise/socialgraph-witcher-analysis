'''Steingrim''' was the first [[Skelliger]] that [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] met after washing up on the shore of [[Ard Skellig]], the largest of the [[Skellige|Skellige Isles]]. He had a companion, a wolf named [[Trofast]].

He made a living by scavenging off of dead bodies that washed up on the shore, though he made the mistake of trying this on Geralt and was taken by surprise as a result.

He is one of the many victims who died at the hand of the [[Berserker (creature)|berserker]]s transformation in [[Kaer Trolde]] during the feast.
