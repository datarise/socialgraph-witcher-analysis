== Journal Entry ==
:''When we arrived in Vergen, we learned that the town's elder was named Cecil Burdon. This former [[Dwarf|dwarven]] miner was typical of his kin - realistic, substantive and possessed of a sober outlook. Vergen needed an administrator like that, so Burdon was, beyond all doubt, the right dwarf in the right place.''
