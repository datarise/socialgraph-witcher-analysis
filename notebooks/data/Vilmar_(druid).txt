'''Vilmar''' was one of many [[druid]]s living in the grotto under the sacred tree [[Gedyneith]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}.

He appeared to be snarky and when another druid approached him in hurry with news about budworms and weevils that had infested every pine on [[Spikeroog]] he said that he would help pesticide.
