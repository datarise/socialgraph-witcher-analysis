}}The '''alchemist''' at the [[Crematory]] in the northeast of the [[Oxenfurt Gate]] was a [[mage]] in hiding, under the guise of an apothecary.

While he doesn't give a unique card, he will play [[gwent]], using the [[Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck|Nilfgaardian deck]].

== Biography ==
In {{Year|year=1271}}, the alchemist attended [[The Summit at Loc Muinne]], condemning [[Radovid V]] for his persecution of mages. [[Carduin]] ordered the alchemist beat and so, after the [[dragon]] attack, he chose to flee the city. He fled to the woods near [[Ban Gleán]], surviving off roots. He then moved to [[Novigrad]], where he started to beg, until he was noticed by the [[Francis Bedlam|King of Beggars]], who provided him work at the Crematory.

In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, if met by [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], he asked the alchemist whether he was selling potion ingredients, but the man lied, saying he was just an apothecary and not a mage, but Geralt saw through his lies, as he had seen the man at the summit at [[Loc Muinne]].

==Notes==
*Despite his account, he cannot be found at the summit during {{Tw2}}.
