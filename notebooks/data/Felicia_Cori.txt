:''Young sorceresses from the school at Aretuza must, apart from passing exams, complete an internship under a mistress' watchful eye. As part of such an internship, the young Felicia Cori peddled [[magic]]al curios of her own production in [[Vergen]].''
:''Hoping to earn approval and a passing grade, Felicia had come to [[Loc Muinne]] with [[Philippa Eilhart|Philippa]]. She waited there for her instructor to find some free time for her.''

=== Journal Entry ===
: ''Geralt had been in situations where he could not prevent someone's death on more than one occasion. In fact, you might say he had grown accustomed to that particular form of agony. It is another thing altogether, however, to stand powerless and watch the unjust, cruel execution of an acquaintance for whom one has developed a fondness.''
: ''Such was his lot as regards Felicia Cori, a young sorceress whom Geralt had met while chasing the kingslayer, Letho. Though Geralt had not gotten to know her deeply, he had nonetheless taken a liking to this former pupil of Philippa Eilhart, who had seemed to him a pleasant and enterprising young woman. Yet she was a wielder of magic and, as such, met her end on a pyre.''

=== Associated Quest ===
*[[Pyres of Novigrad]]

==Notes==
*During the quest With Flickering Heart, Felicia also sells [[surgical tools]] for examining corpses as well as a [[The Rudiments of Pathomorphology|book about autopsies]].
