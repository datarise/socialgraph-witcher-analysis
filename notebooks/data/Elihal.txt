'''Elihal''' was an [[Elf|elven]] tailor who owned a [[Elihal's workshop|workshop]] in the [[Farcorners|outskirts]] of [[Novigrad]]. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] met him on his search for [[Dandelion]].

He's described in [[Dandelion's Planner]] below:

:''A figure most rare, her nature dual.<br>Look deep in her eyes, or be made a fool.''

== Journal Entry ==
: ''Geralt erroneously interpreted one of my notes to mean that Elihal and I had been a couple. Alas, while anyone would be thrilled to count this outstanding elf, wonderful conversation partner and superb tailor among their conquests, in fact no more than friendship and fine wine had ever passed between us.''
: ''Geralt found this out when he visited Elihal's tailor shop, where he also got a first-hand glimpse at the elf's unusual hobby – adopting the dress and mannerisms of those different from himself in race, sex and social status.''
