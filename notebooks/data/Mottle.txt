'''Mottle''' is one of the elven women that can be saved in [[Flotsam]] during Chapter I if Geralt chooses to follow Iorveth to Vergen. If Geralt saves her, she will want to reward him in Chapter II. She also gives Geralt the [[Key to the Tunnel of the Founders]] after receiving his "reward".

She can be found just outside the town of [[Vergen]] where she sells herbs and crafting components. Of course, if Geralt does not save the women from the tower or sides with [[Vernon Roche]], she is nowhere to be found.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[The Floating Prison]]

==Notes==
*In some versions of the game (AU, possibly others) the reward is unavailable as Geralt declines automatically.
