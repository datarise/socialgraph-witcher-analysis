{{Quote|text = An enchantress always takes action. Wrongly or rightly; that is revealed later. But you should act, be brave, seize life by the scruff of the neck. Believe me, little one, you should only regret inactivity, indecisiveness, hesitation. You shouldn't regret actions or decisions, even if they occasionally end in sadness and regret.|citation = Margarita to [[Ciri]], {{ToC}}}}
'''Margarita Laux-Antille''' was a [[sorceress]] and a rector of [[Aretuza]]. She was also the granddaughter of the famous [[Ilona Laux-Antille]] and a founding member of the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]]. She had no interest in politics, but she cared deeply for her school and students.

She had a figure outshining statues, fair-haired, tall, and often wore a green dress with a plunging neckline.<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Relationship with Lars===
In {{Year|year=1263|canon=yes}}, Margarita met [[Lars]], and the two quickly developed a passionate relationship. For four years, their connection slowly dissolved and Margarita felt isolated in her thoughts. This, and his ongoing marriage to another woman, led Margarita to end finally end.<ref name="toc" />

===Meeting Ciri===
In June {{Year|year=1267|canon=yes}}, after moving the adepts to different sleeping areas due to needing the dormitories for the upcoming Grand Mage's Conclave, several students escaped to the [[Gors Velen|main city]] to indulge in its delights. Margarita and [[Tissaia de Vries]] searched the city, detecting a [[magic]]al interference nearby. They found [[Ciri]] and [[Fabio Sachs]] hiding from an angry crowd; and believing she was one of the missing students, Tissaia put her under a paralysis spell while Margarita held off Fabio. They took the young clerk's advice and carried the girl to [[Giancardi Bank]], where [[Yennefer of Vengerberg]] proved Ciri's identity, followed by constant apologies from the rectors. They all, save Fabio, went back to [[The Silver Heron]] inn, and bathed for several hours, until Ciri decided to flee to [[Hirundum]], followed by Yennefer.<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref>

===Deireadh Prison===
On the 6th of [[Birke]]<ref name="lop">''[[List of prisoners]]''</ref>, or around March 20, {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, she was captured by [[witch hunter]]s during the [[Witch hunts|raids]] in [[Novigrad]].

Margarita Laux-Antille is mentioned by ambassador [[Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen]], as one of the sorceresses accused to be a member of the conspiracy, which murdered both [[King]] [[Demavend III|Demavend]] and [[Foltest]]. She is also sentenced to death, as well as the other members of the Lodge of Sorceresses.

She is also mentioned by Geralt as co-author of the compendium ''Masters of Magic on Curses – Selected Writings'', with [[Tissaia de Vries]].

=={{tw3}}==
After the massacre at [[Loc Muinne]], Margarita, along with the other Northern Lodge sorceresses, went into hiding. However, she still kept in contact with Philippa and the two discussed a plan in hopes to reform the Lodge. However, those plans were put on hold. Fearing [[witch hunter]]s would inevitably attack Aretuza, Margarita and her students went to Novigrad, hearing Triss was organizing an escape for mages to [[Kovir]]. Sadly, she and her students were captured and imprisoned, and her pupils were burned one by one, with Radovid saving Margarita for last. Luckily, she was rescued by Geralt and Yennefer before her execution.

=== Journal Entry ===
:''The full list of Margarita Laux-Antille's outstanding mental, spiritual and physical attributes would consume a mountain of parchment. Rita, as her friends called her, once held the position of rector at the Aretuza Academy for Sorceresses on the Isle of Thanedd - the same school attended by her famous ancestor, Ilona Laux-Antille.''
:''Quite unusually for one of her profession, Margarita showed no interest in politics - it was only care for the good of her school that led her to join the Lodge of Sorceresses.''
:''Finally, her beauty deserves mention as well. It was said that not even the marble likenesses of goddesses and nymphs chiseled out by the greatest sculptors could rival this sorceress's figure.''
:''Yet with all her astuteness, Laux-Antille still could not escape the same fate that so many of her fellows met. She had been arrested some time before our tale begins and was staying in the Oxenfurt prison, awaiting a summary and pre-determined trial.''
:''Only Geralt and Yennefer's daring jailbreak saved Margarita from certain execution.''
