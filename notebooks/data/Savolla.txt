{{Quote|text = Savolla, I know him. A mage - as ambitious as he is insane...|citation = Triss Merigold regarding Savolla, {{Tw1}}}}
'''Savolla''' was an ambitious [[mage]] working for the [[Salamandra]], further training [[magic]] under its leader [[Azar Javed]]. With an enthralled [[frightener]], Savolla was a vital part of the Sallamandra's attack on the [[School of the Wolf]] but died during the fight.

== Biography ==
=== Attack on Kaer Morhen ===
Before the attack itself, Savolla had a sort of argument with the [[Professor (assassin)|Professor]], Sallamandra's other leader who was afraid there would be no [[witcher]] left for him to fight after Savolla led the principal charge.

In May {{Year|year=1270}}, Savolla accompanied his master Azar Javed and the Professor during the attack on [[Kaer Morhen]]. Like other Salamandra mages, he preferred to let the non-magical ranks deal with the actual crossing of swords while he hanged back using [[magic]] to summon all sorts of extra foes and effects. Savolla was more powerful than many of his brethren, enough to control a frightener. Even that, however, did not save him from his death at the hands of either [[Geralt of Rivia]] or [[Triss Merigold]].<ref>{{Tw1}}</ref>

=== Legacy ===
Years later, the hole in the walls of Kaer Morhen left by the Salamandra attack became known as the "Savolla's breach", remaining in place as the Wolf witchers had no time to repair it. The [[Wild Hunt]] eventually utilized this weakness during [[the Battle of Kaer Morhen]].<ref>{{Tw3}}</ref>
