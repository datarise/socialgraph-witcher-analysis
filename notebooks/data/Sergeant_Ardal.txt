'''Ardal''' was the most respected and influential of the [[Phillip Strenger|Bloody Baron]]'s militia while at [[Crow's Perch]]. He served alongside the "baron" in the war, but after their group was massacred by [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] soldiers, Phillip, Ardal, and the remnants of the [[Temeria]]n forces in [[Velen]] took over Crow's Perch and ruled over the region, and though they maintained order, the Baron and his men harassed and brutalized the locals.

Around this time, Ardal also became the champion of Velen's fist-fighting ring.

{{Condition|Text = If [[Return to Crookback Bog]] is completed}} after the Baron left or hanged himself, Ardal took over, beginning an even harsher reign of terror.
