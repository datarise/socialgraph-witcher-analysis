[[File:People Poor Townsfolk.png|right|The Gossip]]
The '''poor townsfolk''' fill the [[Temple Quarter]], locked in with the [[non-human]]s and the victims of [[Catriona]], trying to go about their daily lives as best as they can. The quarter is filled with the sick, the poor and the dispossessed. Bandits, thugs and other [[lowlife]] roam the darker areas of the quarter and openly in the slums.

== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ==
The way to get this journal entry (and corresponding romance card) is to either give [[Clothing|red women's gloves]] or [[Precious stones|a diamond]] to the Gossip who is walking around the [[Temple Quarter]]. She tends to stay around Roper Street, Hospital Street and the run from Peddler street to the [[Gate to the Dike]]. This might take several stabs at the conversation, she is easily distracted.

:''City life is a departure from the peaceful rhythms of the countryside. The locals here are more confident. They know what they want.''

== Note ==
* The Gossip's Romance Card: When you ask the Gossip about ''"... news of a witcher in town"'', following up with ''"fancies women"'' you will get one of three randomly created continuations of the dialogue — one version mentions ''Dandelion'', another ''"good friends"'', but only ''"it's hard to live up to a legend"'' will make the Gossip ask for a gift as proof:
** '''Some sort of frock:''' A shawl, silk scarf, or red shawl will prompt a preference for gloves. Both the red and gold woman's gloves will be accepted.
** '''A precious stone:''' A amber, ruby, and sapphire prompt a preference for diamonds. And only a diamond is accepted.
* Should the above not work the first time, then you will need to wait a day and talk to the Gossip again. This may take several tries.
