'''Ilsa''' was a woman from the [[Outskirts]] of [[Vizima]] whom the [[City Guard|guard]], [[Mikul]], fancied. Hers is but one sad story [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] uncovers during his stay in the [[Outskirts]].
== Associated Quests ==
* [[Buried Memories]]
* [[Of Monsters and Men]] (indirectly)

== Notes ==
* She has the same model and texture as [[Vesna Hood|Vesna]].
* Ilsa's corpse can be found inside the [[Crypt in the outskirts|crypt]] during [[The Ghoul Contract (1)|the Ghoul Contract]], an empty glass vial in her hand.
* Near the end of the chapter, it is implied that the Salamandra thugs had their way with her, and [[Abigail]] accuses [[Mikul]] of raping her, too. One might say that what comes out of [[Alvin]]'s mouth during the "spell" Abigail casts on him in order to find out why [[Hellhound|the Beast]] haunts the [[Outskirts]] also refers to that incident.
* The poison Ilsa used to take her own life came from [[Abigail]].
