'''Odo''' is a rich merchant who lives in the [[Outskirts]] of [[Vizima]], in fact, he is the richest person in the Outskirts, period. He is often drunk and if he is not, then he will invite you to [[Intoxication|help him get that way]] without delay. He believes in the [[Eternal Fire]] and respects the [[Reverend]]'s authority in the village. He also firmly believes that anyone who will drink with you could not possibly be a spy. A spy? What is he hiding?
