}}The '''old brickmaker''' was one of the workers living in the [[Brickmakers' village|village]] in the [[swamp]] near [[Vizima]].

== Biography ==
When he was just six years old, a brick fell on his head which made his speech somewhat defect. However, he could still provide a lot of information about the swamp.<ref>{{Tw1}}</ref>

At some point between {{Year|year = 1270}} and {{Year|year = 1272}}, he moved to a small village south of [[Byways]] in [[Velen]] and at times reminisced about brickworks near Vizima.<ref>{{Tw3}}</ref>
