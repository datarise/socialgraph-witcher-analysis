'''Townsfolk''' refers to the inhabitants of the [[Trade Quarter]]. More affluent than their counterparts in the [[Temple Quarter]], they have the opportunity to enjoy some of the finer things in life. But for some, not having to work means not having much of anything to do.

== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ==
This entry is received after retrieving [[Dandelion]]'s [[Dandelion's Lute|lute]], after spending some "time" with Rozalind Pankiera. She has heard that the touch of a witcher "tingles"...

:''Unmarried townswomen are treated strictly by their parents and largely kept at home. They're a bit bored, but also curious.''

== Note ==
You should first speak with Dandelion in The New Narakort inn and take the "[[Dandelion's Lute]]" quest from him, before speaking with Rozalind and taking the lute from the trunk in her room or you will miss the "Townsfolk" Journal Entry '''and''' Rozalind's sex card!
