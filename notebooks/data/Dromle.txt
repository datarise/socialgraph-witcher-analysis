'''Dromle'''<ref>Mikah addresses Dromle by name in an ambient conversation as soon as the objective to question the tavern's visitors begins</ref> was a peasant from [[White Orchard]].

== Biography ==
In May {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he and his friend, [[Mikah]], were having a drink at the [[White Orchard inn]] when the [[witcher]]s [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Vesemir]] passed through in their search for [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt approaches the two}} Dromle showed obvious contempt towards the witcher, telling Geralt to leave and how he was ruining their drink.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt uses Axii on Mikah}} Dromle tried to attract attention form the others over this [[Magic|witchcraft]] but quieted down when Geralt threatened him.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt simply presses on them to answer}} Dromle finally answered the question, stating they haven't seen or heard of such a woman.

== Associated Quest ==
*[[Lilac and Gooseberries]]

== Notes ==
* Speaking to Mikah and Dromle is completely optional, as speaking to [[Gaunter O'Dimm]], is the only patron required to speak to Geralt to advance the quest.
