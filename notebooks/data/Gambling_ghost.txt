[[File:People Gambling ghost full.png|right|200px|the Gambling Ghost]]'''Gambling Ghost''' is what remains of a man obsessed with dice. He would not let such a small thing like death keep him from his passion. This is (was?) no mere hobby. Quite possibly the writer of the [[Diary of a Dice Collector]]. This is confirmed in the Polish (original) version of the game where he is called ''"Duch Kolekcjonera Kości"'' which translated into English means "Ghost of the Dice Collector".

He can be found at the [[Ruins|fairytale ruins]] outside the village of [[Murky Waters]] in Chapter IV ''(see [[#Notes|Notes]] below)''.

When the witcher first meets the ghost, the latter exclaims ''"Geralt of Rivia himself... you're renowned in the realm of the dead."'' It seems our hero's reputation knows no bounds.

If Geralt chose [[Triss]] to be [[Alvin]]'s guardian in Chapter III, then he has to rescue [[Alvin]] from the Gambling Ghost, either through a fight or by beating him at a game of [[The Witcher dice poker|dice]]. If he does not kill the wraith to save Alvin, he has the choice to either let him live and keep him as a poker opponent, or send him to the great beyond.

== Associated Quests ==
* [[Alvin (quest)|Alvin]]
* [[Dice Poker: The Sharper]]

== Notes ==
* Killing the Gambling Ghost nets Geralt 200 {{oren}} in addition to the XP.
* If you left Alvin with Triss in Chapter III, the Ghost will not appear above his skeleton until you advance the Alvin quest to the point after you are told to give him the amulet.
