'''Trygvi''' was one of inhabitants of [[Lofoten]] who survived the attack of the [[Wild Hunt]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. He and his wife both came out of the attack without sustaining any injuries, except mental trauma. He wanted to rake off the snow that [[Eredin]] and his men brought to the village from the roof of his house, but his wife told him to rather not do it, as it could bring some misfortune.
