}}'''St. Gregory''' was a hero of [[Novigrad]] living in the 10th century who was declared a saint after saving the city from a horrible famine by sacrificing half his fortune to import food from [[Nazair]]. The [[St. Gregory's Bridge|bridge]] connecting [[Temple Isle]] with the rest of Novigrad is named after him.

Is it not clear if it is the same person which was mentioned in the first game - an inquisitor, author of litany, who, according to legend, died in the ancient crypt after defending himself from the heretics.
