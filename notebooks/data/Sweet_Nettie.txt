'''Sweet Nettie''' was a [[prostitute]] working at [[Crippled Kate's]] in [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt investigates into [[Priscilla]]'s attacker}} Sweet Nettie's services were bought by [[Nathaniel Pastodi]], who asked her if she'd do anything and she responded yes, for the right price. However, this turned out not to be a question about sex. Nathaniel tied and gagged her before he began to torture her with a hot [[Poker (weapon)|poker]] when [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] burst in, intent on finding and putting a stop to the serial killer in the area.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Carnal Sins]]

== Notes ==
* Oddly, even if you interfere and use [[Axii]] to make Nathaniel leave her alone, the two will remain in the room afterwards.
