'''Felix Grubb''' was a [[Redania]]n captain that commanded a regiment stationed at the [[Border Post]] to prevent refugees from swarming through into [[Novigrad]] and Redania.

When talking to [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], he makes it clear in his comments that he's racist, wanting to punishing the [[Elf|elves]] in the camp in retaliation for the small [[Scoia'tael]] unit that was killing off supply transports despite not having any evidence those in the camp were helping them.
