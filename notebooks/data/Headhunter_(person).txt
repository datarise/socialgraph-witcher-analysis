[[File:People_Jean-Pierre_full.png|right|200px|Headhunter]]
A '''headhunter''' is a character which appears if [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] kills one or more mercenaries, in particular, mercenaries guarding the [[Outskirts Inn|Inn]] in the [[Outskirts]] and [[City Guard|city guards]] in [[Temple Quarter]]. The same model as [[Jean-Pierre]] is used, so do not be confused! He is extremely difficult to defeat and has a very tough attack.

The only reported successful method of killing him to date has been to use the same strategy that is used to kill the [[golem]] in the [[swamp]], which is to say, the [[the Sentry|pylons]] and a good electrical storm. However, there is nothing to be found in his remains and a second '''headhunter''' will come for [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]].
