'''Bernard Tulle''' was a [[halfling]] and according to him, a mushrooms farmer working for the [[Zerrikanian Spice Company]] in [[Novigrad]].

He participated in the [[Gwent]] tournament of the [[Passiflora]] using the [[Northern Realms Gwent deck|Northern Realms deck]]. His skills in this particular card game were however quite ridiculous, but it sort of made sense: Bernard was not at all a simple spices merchant; indeed, he was a professional thief who entered the tournament just to steal the 9000 [[Crown]]s prize.
