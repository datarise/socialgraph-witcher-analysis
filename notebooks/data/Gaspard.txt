'''Gaspard Sutter''' was a [[dwarf]] from [[Mahakam]] and a member of [[Rabenick and Company]], a real estate appraisal business.

He suffered from severe narcolepsy, and was constantly troubled by it.
 
==Biography==
In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, the company got stuck on the [[Isle of Mists]], while travelling for business.

Gaspard along with two others, Ivo and Ferenc, had set out in different directions in search for help or a way off the island when he ended up at the top of the [[Lighthouse (Isle of Mists)|lighthouse]] before falling asleep. Luckily [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] arrived in his search for [[Ciri]] and found the sleeping dwarf. He then revealed to Geralt that he suffered from narcolepsy and that the [[witcher]] must wake him up repeatedly on the way back to the [[Strange Cottage|hut]] where his remaining comrades were.

The two troubled up the cliffs towards the hut, along the way Gaspard kept falling asleep as they were being attacked by [[harpy|harpies]]. After reaching his friends, the dwarf left the two witchers and the company returned to the shoreline to prepare their boat.
