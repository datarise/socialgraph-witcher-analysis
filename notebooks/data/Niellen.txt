'''Niellen''' was a hunter who, in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272
|Type = game}}, lived in [[Blackbough]] with his wife [[Hanna]] and sister-in-law, [[Margrit]]. Unknown to most, he was also a werewolf, though appeared to live rather peacefully among people by taking precautions of hiding himself far away from others during his transformations.

== Biography ==
One night however, Hanna went missing and he tried to find what happened to her, firmly believing she wouldn't just leave him.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt lies}} [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] came along and Niellen asked him to see what he could learn what became of Hanna but sadly reported that she had died. Niellen appeared to take it well enough, but a few days later it was noted he had died himself.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps and fully investigates}} Geralt, in his search to find what happened to Hanna, soon ran into Niellen, but this time as a werewolf. As the two fought, Margrit ran in to stop them, proclaiming she'd been in love with Niellen for a long time despite knowing he was a werewolf. She then revealed she was the reason for Hanna's death: she'd meant to simply have Hanna see Niellen during one of his transformations hoping Hanna would be disgusted and leave the hunter, but Niellen, in a blind bloodlust, killed his wife instead. Niellen, incensed at this, threatened to take out his revenge on Margrit.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt lets him take his revenge}} Deciding not to interfere, Geralt stood aside as Niellen killed Margrit for her role in Hanna's death. Niellen then went before Geralt and asked the [[witcher]] to kill him and put him out of his misery and the witcher obliged.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt protects Margrit}} Deciding killing another wouldn't help the situation, Geralt stood in Niellen's way and killed the hunter.
