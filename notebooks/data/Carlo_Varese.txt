'''Carlo Varese''', better known as '''Cleaver''', was one of the [[Big Four|four]] main crime bosses of [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon = No|year = 1272}}, alongside [[Francis Bedlam]], [[Cyprian Wiley|Whoreson Junior]], and [[Sigi Reuven]]. He ran a [[Crownsplitters|gang]] primarily made up of other [[Dwarf|dwarves]].

== Journal Entry ==
: ''A joke circulating through the back alleys and seedy taverns of Novigrad claimed the dwarf Carlo Varese, one of the four leading lights of the local criminal strata, was, in his own way, a fierce proponent of racial coexistence. He applied this principle in a rather selective fashion, however.''
: ''Cleaver firmly felt that he personally had every right, as an assimilated inhabitant of the city of Novigrad, to run his own business. Anyone who had a problem with the way he ran it or the nature of its dealings, be he dwarf, [[human]] or [[halfling]], revealed himself as a vile racist. The only fitting thing to do with such scum? Feed them to a herd of ferociously hungry hogs – right after slicing off the interloper's fingers with his namesake cleaver. Such tales, of course, could very well have been mere rumor and slander – but very few had the courage test their veracity.''
: ''Cleaver was famed for his hot-temper. What boiled his blood hottest of all, however, was when somebody thought they could pull one over on him.''
: ''No wonder, then, that the attack by Whoreson's thugs got him somewhat riled up. The violent tirade he directed at Wiley clearly contained not idle threats but promises he meant to keep, even if doing so meant demolishing half the neighborhood.''

== Associated Quests ==
* [[The Gangs of Novigrad]]
* [[Get Junior]]
* [[Race: The Great Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby]]

== Notes ==
* If Geralt helps [[Triss Merigold|Triss]] evacuate the mages during the quest [[Now or Never]], the [[Witch hunter|witch hunters]] turn their attention to the non-humans. Later, when [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Ciri]] return to Novigrad during the quest [[Final Preparations]], an epilogue slide shows Cleaver is taken by the witch hunters and burned at the stake.
