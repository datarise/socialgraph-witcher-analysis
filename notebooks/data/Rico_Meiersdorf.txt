In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} the [[halfling]] was working for [[Francis Bedlam]], better known as the ''King of Beggars'', as a [[spy]]. However [[Cyprian Wiley]], the person Rico was tasked to spy on, exposed him and brought him to his [[Whoreson Junior's casino|casino]] in order to torture him and learn all the information he knew.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Rico}} Luckily for the halfling, the [[witcher]] [[Geralt of Rivia]] freed him and helped him escape from Wiley's casino. The King of Beggars later recommended he leave the city for his safety.
