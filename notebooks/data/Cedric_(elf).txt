'''Cedric''' was an [[Elf|elven]] [[The Witcher 2 merchants|merchant]] and [[craftsman]] who can usually be found on or near the observation platform in [[Lobinden]].

It is revealed that Cedric was once a member of the [[Scoia'tael]] and suffered from frequent visions. However, it is not explained if the visions were about his Scoia'tael past or premonitions of the future like [[Jacques de Aldersberg]] (although [[Triss Merigold]] suggested the latter). Regardless, he usually spent most of his time drinking heavily trying to avoid having them--something that [[Geralt of Rivia]] admitted that he understood very well.

In his quest to destroy the [[kayran]], Geralt was pointed in the direction of Cedric, who helped him find the monster. Later, Cedric told the [[witcher]] where he could find some ostmurk in order to make the [[Mongoose]] potion. As a craftsman, Cedric sold various items, including formulae for weapon oil and potions (including for Mongoose), bombs, and the design for a [[kayran trap]].

Soon afterwards, Cedric helped to protect Triss when she was attacked by [[Letho]]. However, the kingslayer managed to fatally wound Cedric, so he fled into the forest. Cedric was eventually found by Geralt, who had followed a trail of the elf's blood. As he lay dying, Cedric told Geralt about what had happened and noticed how the animal life in the forest came to bid him farewell before he passed away.

== Journal Entry ==
:''For reasons that were not entirely clear, this wise and experienced elf had chosen to live among [[human]]s. He worked for the people of [[Flotsam]] as a lookout and trapper, and none had a better knowledge of the surrounding forests. Whether it was the local plants and wildlife or the dangers that lurked amidst the trees, Cedric was the local inhabitants' chief and often only source of information.''
:''Heroism sometimes exacts the highest price. When Triss' life was in danger, the elf did not hesitate to defend her and was wounded - mortally, as it turned out. Thus Cedric died, though his sacrifice was not in vain.''
