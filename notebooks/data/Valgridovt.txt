However, the boy in the game appears far too young to be doing such and his protector, Viki, appears more as the one in charge when he's interacted with.

== Biography ==
[[Viki]] was named protector of the young boy and the two boarded one of the two ships set for [[Beauclair]], where they were likely seeking asylum.

However, the [[Dirgelech|usurper]] back home sent warriors after them and one of the ships wrecked on an island in [[Skellige]], though luckily Viki and the young prince were on the other ship. The two made it as far as [[Ursten]] in [[Velen]] before their ship also crashed, stranding them in a foreign land and, to make matters worse, Viki couldn't speak any of the [[Common Speech|local language]]. They then took refuge in [[Widows' Grotto]] as Viki tried to figure out what to do next.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt finds them and protects them}} now that the last warrior that'd been following them was dead, Viki and Valgridovt set out once more.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt finds them but stands aside}} the boy's last line of defense was literally cut down in front of him by the warrior, who conversed with Valgridovt before taking him back home.
