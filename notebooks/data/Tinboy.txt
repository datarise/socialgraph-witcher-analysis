{{Quote|text = Tinboy's oldman labored as a metalworker. On his sober days, he smelted tin. On his drinking days, he smelted his son's face.|citation = {{Gwent standalone}}}}'''Tinboy''' was a man in the service of the [[Francis Bedlam|King of Beggars]], one of the [[Big Four]] of [[Novigrad]], around {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

==Biography==
{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Hattori negotiate}} Tinboy was sent as the King of Beggars' representative to negotiate getting supplies for [[Ã‰ibhear Hattori]] for his swordsmithing business. However, just as the group came to an agreement, they were ambushed by [[Carlo Varese|Cleaver]]'s [[Crownsplitters|men]]. Tinboy, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], and Hattori managed to escape but several of the Cleaver's gang members undoubtedly escaped as well, and thus inform Cleaver of the rivalry. Aware of this, Tinboy informed Geralt it was best if Hattori had a bodyguard until a truce was called between the two gang leaders.
