}}Lieutenant General '''Harmon aep Groenekan''', commander of Second Mounted Army of [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]], was a connoisseur and collector of armors. During {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he demanded that the armorers at [[Crow's Perch]] in [[Velen]] make him a suit, but insisted that the finished product be tested before paying. This evolved into small contest of skills between [[Fergus Graem|Fergus]] and [[Yoana]].
