'''Rayla''' of [[Lyria]],<ref name="boe">{{BoE}}</ref> known first as '''Black Rayla'''<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref> and later as '''White Rayla''',<ref name="tlotl">{{TLotL}}</ref> was a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the [[Northern Wars|wars]] with [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]]. She was a mercenary and later an officer of the [[Aedirnian Special Forces|special forces]] of [[King]] [[Demavend III]] of [[Aedirn]]. While she was guarding the withdrawal of civilians from invaded Aedirn, her unit was wiped out by [[Scoia'tael]] commandos.<ref name="toc" /> She survived the capture, albeit maimed and disfigured.<ref name="tlotl" />

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}Rayla was the daughter of an [[Elf|elven]] woman and a [[human]] man, making her a [[Half-elf|half-elf]]. She was born in [[Lyria]], where she lived in a hamlet. Her neighbors, however, fearing [[Scoia'tael]] commandos, showed nothing but hatred towards Rayla and her family, who were constantly bullied, discriminated against, and beaten. In the end, Rayla started hating [[non-human]]s even more than her former neighbors, despite secretly being one of them.<ref name="TB">{{TB}}</ref>

{{Canon Marker End|Type=games}}
She early became a mercenary and departed for adventures. At some point in her life she met [[Geralt of Rivia]], witnessed his fighting skills, and became impressed by them. She also visited [[Vengerberg]] a few times.<ref name="boe" />

She fought for [[Nordling]]s during the [[Northern War I|First Northern War]]. Later, she participated in a gathering at [[Bleobheris]], during which she watched [[Dandelion]]'s performance and discussed with other spectators the events described in his ballad.<ref name="boe" />

=== Aedirnian Special Forces ===
Some time later, Rayla joined the Aedirnian Special Forces formed by King Demavend. In June {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1267}}, she was tasked with escorting Archmistress [[Tissaia de Vries]] to [[The Silver Heron]] in [[Gors Velen]]. There, [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] argued that Rayla, as a "mercenary" fighting for money, would not be able to make sacrifices like the soldiers who fought with conviction and sacrifice, while [[Margarita Laux-Antille]] defended the captain. After completing her duties, she left with her unit back to Aedirn.<ref name="toc" />

=== Early stages of war ===
{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}When the [[Second Northern War]] broke out, Rayla's unit was sent by King Demavend to defend [[Lower Aedirn]] from [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] invaders. However, instead of Nilfgaardians, the unit faced a vanguard of Scoia'tael, who captured Rayla's men and attempted to execute them. Fortunately for them, the [[Elf|elves]] were all slaughtered by a convoy of [[Lyria and Rivia|Lyrian]] soldiers who were passing nearby. Surprisingly for Rayla, the unit was led by none other than [[Meve]], Queen of Lyria and Rivia, who was escaping from her country after the [[Lyrian golpe]] and was entering Aedirn, where she was hoping to receive military aid from King Demavend. Driven by common interest, Rayla and her men joined Meve's party and headed to [[Rosberg]], where the King was last seen.

Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion proceeded without obstacle and what remained of Rosberg was burned ruins. One of the few survivors, [[Xavier Lemmens]], informed Queen Meve and Rayla that King Demavend left Rosberg before the siege and was now preparing his defense at [[Aldersberg]].

At Aldersberg, the unit finally met King Demavend; Nilfgaardian troops commanded by Field Marshal [[Menno Coehoorn]], however, had already started besieging the city.<ref name="TB" />

{{Canon Marker End|Type=games}}
In the end Lyrians and Aedirnians joined forces and clashed against the Nilfgaardians in what would be later known as the [[First battle of Aldersberg|First Battle of Aldersberg]]. Although Meve and Demavend's troops were defeated and Aldersberg was burned down, the two monarchs managed to save both their lives and those of the citizens of Aldersberg.<ref name="toc" />

{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}
Following the battle, Demavend fled to [[Redania]]. Before leaving Meve, however, he handed her the [[Leaden Ring]], a token which would've given her permission to enter the enclave of [[Mahakam]] and ask for military help from [[Brouver Hoog]], the [[Elder-in-Chief]]. The King of Aedirn also tasked Rayla with escorting the Queen to her destination.

In Mahakam, Rayla was forced to leave Meve because she had to return in [[Aedirn]], since Nilfgaardian troops were now heading towards Demavend's capital, [[Vengerberg]].<ref name="TB" /><ref group="N">During Thronebreaker it is possible to keep Rayla as a companion for the whole playtrough. This choice however contradicts [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s canon, with Rayla attending the sack of Vengerberg and being defeated by Scoia'tael.</ref>

{{Canon Marker End|Type=games}}

=== Sack of Vengerberg ===
[[File:Denis_Gordeev_Rayla.jpeg|Surrounded by Scoia'tael|thumb|Rayla surrounded by Scoia'tael]]
After the [[Sack of Vengerberg|Battle of Vengerberg]] was won by [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]], Rayla's unit protected the civilians fleeing through the [[Pontar Valley]] to [[Temeria]]. When the Aedirnian army's rearguard was obliterated by Scoia'tael, she ordered her men to stay and become the rearguard themselves, despite their reluctance. She was the last to stand after a fierce battle, surrounded by Scoia'tael. They asked her to drop her weapon, but she replied her sword was too expensive to drop and if they wished to take it, they should break her fingers to do so.<ref name="toc" />

=== White Rayla ===
Rayla appears again in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1268}} – not with broken fingers but missing her whole hand, replaced by a steel hook. While she survived, she apparently suffered much; even her hair turned white. Calling herself "White Rayla", she was full of rage and hatred towards the Scoia'tael. After the [[Battle of Brenna]] she pursued [[Toruviel]]'s commandos.<ref name="tlotl" />

{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}
Five years after the Battle of Brenna, Rayla continued her hunt for the remaining Scoia'tael while acting as a mercenary for the [[Order of the Flaming Rose]]. Leading a unit of Knights of the Order, Rayla arrived in [[Murky Waters]], a small town near [[Vizima]], after hearing of the presence of Toruviel's commandos. After the elves took the villagers hostage, Rayla entrusted the [[witcher]] [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to tell the elves that she promised a fair trail if they freed the hostages. However, Rayla was then stripped of her command of the unit by an Order adjuntant, citing a letter from [[Siegfried_of_Denesle|Siegfried]], in order to take the elves head-on.

During the conflict in [[Old Vizima]], Rayla, still working for the Order of the Flaming Rose, was shot twice in the chest by [[Yaevinn]]'s arrows, leaving her in a near-death state. Later on, she was found and taken by the [[Salamandra]] in order to subject her to their mutation process. She thus survived her wounds at the cost of losing most of her mental faculties. She was then used to attack Geralt, who finally put an end to her life.

Rayla is a character in Thronebreaker. She can be recruited by Meve as a companion at the start of the quest [[Ashes of Aedirn]].

[[File:People Rayla full.png|thumb|Rayla in game]]
Depending on the [[The Witcher storyline|path]] Geralt chose, White Rayla was one of three possible, but mutually exclusive, [[Romance card|sexual]] partners Geralt can have in Chapter V. He will sleep with her if he chooses the Order path.

=== Associated Quests ===
* [[Free Elves]]
* [[Sweet Revenge]]
* [[The Flame that Cleanses]]

=== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ===
:''The hunt for the free elves who had been resting near Murky Waters was led by White Rayla, a mercenary hired by the Order. Rayla is a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the wars with Nilfgaard, during which she was maimed and disfigured. Rayla is used to discipline and has but one passion — she hates elves and hunts them with unwavering ruthlessness.''
:''Rayla surrounded Toruviel's elves in the village of Murky Waters, but the situation got out of control. A fight broke out between her soldiers and the elves.''
:'''If Geralt complete the Order path:'''
::''I decided to help Rayla during the siege of Murky Waters, thus helping her to defeat Toruviel's elves.''
:''White Rayla returned to Vizima. She was slain by elven arrows as non-humans and knights of the Order clashed in the burning city.''
:''I met the mercenary again. Salamandra found her close to death and subjected her to mutation. Rayla recuperated and , as a mutant, regained her strength in no time. In return for her second life, she had to swear absolute loyalty to her new masters. She tried to stop me and I had to kill her. For good this time.''

== Notes ==
*After the end of the [[Second Nilfgaard War]], White Rayla is described as being heavily disfigured (with at least two big facial scars), missing half of her right ear, and having a brass hook in place of her left hand. However, in the game none of these afflictions are present, even contradicting her own in-game journal entry which states that "she was maimed and disfigured". Also, her hair at that point in the book is already all white (presumably the cause for her change of alias from "Black Rayla"), whereas in the game she is portrayed as still having black hair.
