He broke his leg and his friend [[Ulf]] didn't know how to help, though was chastising Petter for complaining about breaking his leg.

If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] passes by, he can choose to help, by giving Petter a little bit of [[Celandine]], a herb which wouldn't fix his leg but it wouldn't hurt as much.
