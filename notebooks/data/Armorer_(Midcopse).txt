The '''armorer''' based in [[Midcopse]] is a [[gwent]] player and uses the [[Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck|Nilfgaardian Empire deck]].

When introducing himself, he advertised the [[Gabriel (weapon)|Gabriel]] [[crossbow]], which is contradictory as he did not sell this crossbow nor any weapons of his own. He sells [[Edwin Greloff]]'s [[Edwin Greloff's first map|first]] and [[Edwin Greloff's second map|second]] maps as well as a variety of crafting diagrams.
