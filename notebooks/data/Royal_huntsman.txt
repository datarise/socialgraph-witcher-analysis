}}The '''Royal Huntsman''' can be found throughout {{Tw1}}. In particular, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] first meets him in the [[Outskirts]], again in the [[Trade Quarter]], and finally in a cave in the [[swamp cemetery]]. He's the primary source of information on hunts for [[The Witcher trophy quests|exceptional]] monsters, paying a bounty for each trophy brought to him as proof of success.

After the player turns in all 10 trophies they can talk to the Royal Huntsman again; he offers a choice between a [[steel sword]] and a [[silver sword]]. The steel sword is the [[Mahakaman Rune Sihil]], and the silver sword is [[Moonblade]].
