}}'''Holofernes Meiersdorf''' was a [[halfling]] that ran the successful [[Honeyfill Meadworks]] east of [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} and was the father of 4 sons: Franklin, Bernie, Hugo, and [[Rico Meiersdorf|Rico]]. However, the last one decided to seek out his own path and left for Novigrad and began to work for the [[Francis Bedlam|King of Beggars]] but Holofernes held out hope that Rico would one day return.

However, his bee business ran into a problem when something they called [[The Apiarian Phantom]] was destroying bee hives and had killed a farmhand. If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] helps him out, he'll learn that it was a lone [[Hound of the Wild Hunt|Wild Hunt hound]].
