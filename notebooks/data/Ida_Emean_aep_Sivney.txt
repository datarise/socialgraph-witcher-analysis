'''Ida Emean aep Sivney''' was an [[Elf|elven]] [[Mage|sorceress]] from the [[Blue Mountains]] and a member of the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]] and an ''[[Aen Saevherne]]'', a sage. She didn't wear precious metals or stones, preferring pearls, coral, and amber over them.

== Biography ==
{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, when [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] discovered that the being, [[Uma]], had some connection to finding [[Ciri]], Yennefer contacted Ida using a [[megascope]]. After pronouncing the incantation of the curse, Ida starts to back away, but when pressed she reveals that it was a powerful curse in the forgotten language, [[One Speech]]. She gave the two advice on possible solutions to reversing the curse, then warning them that the [[Elder blood]] could initiate or stop the [[White Frost]] and that Geralt will be the one to influence the events. Later, when [[Triss Merigold|Triss]] tries to contact help from the Lodge to fight the [[Wild Hunt]], Ida outright refused.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Ida Emean movie poster comparison.jpg|thumb|Left - Agata Trzebuchowska in ''Ida'' movie; Right - Ida Emean in the game|200x200px]]
* Ida's face was inspired by and modeled after [[wikipedia:Agata Trzebuchowska|Agata Trzebuchowska]]'s role in ''[[wikipedia:Ida (film)|Ida]]'', a well awarded Polish drama film from 2013. Both characters share not only their appearance, red hair, and name, but also personality traits: both heroines are quiet and a bit secretive and belonged to closed organizations.

== Notes ==
* {{PN}}, [[Reim]] mentions her in a comment to [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] about mages.
* In {{Tw2}}, she's accused of being part of the conspiracy and sentenced to death with the rest of the Lodge.
* In {{Tw3}} she has a [[Ida Emean aep Sivney (gwent card)|card]] that's part of the [[Scoia'tael Gwent deck|Scoia'tael deck]].
