'''Hjort''' was a [[druid]], and an advisor to [[Udalryk]], the jarl of [[Spikeroog]].

== Journal Entry ==
: ''It is my humble opinion that the most one can learn from staring at the innards of a gutted animal is whether the poor beast was infested with parasites. Nevertheless, Hjort, like many other druids of [[Skellige]], placed a great deal of trust in both haruspicy and chiromancy (and [[Oneiromancer|oneiromancy]] as well, though that's more understandable, dreams being the royal route to one's soul).''
: ''Word was that he commanded a great deal of respect and esteem amongst his fellow practitioners, having more than once accurately prophesied the future and interpreted the meaning of obtuse dreams. This druid was devoted to [[Clan Brokvar]] with all his heart, and his knowledge and ability made him an excellent advisor, one in whom the jarl of Spikeroog, Udalryk of Clan Brokvar, placed a great deal of trust.''
: ''Hjort had tried to alleviate the suffering brought on by his jarl's strange condition, but despite his efforts no progress was made in stopping the decline in Udalryk's mental health.''
