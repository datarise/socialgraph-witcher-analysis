'''Eyvind''' was a [[skald]] from [[Arinbjorn]] and considered an expert on legends about [[Aen Elle]] and [[Aen Seidhe]] [[elf|elves]] and even translated a legend about Gealbhan. Even though he had this extensive knowledge his only true life goal was to see the legendary white [[whale]], [[Gevorg]], and write the first trustworthy ballad about it.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt sought out his help}} the creature finally swam by but he was distracted in talking to Geralt and thus didn't see Gevorg.
