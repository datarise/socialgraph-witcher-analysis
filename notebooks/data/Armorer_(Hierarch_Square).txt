The '''armorer''' in [[Hierarch Square]] operated out of a small store in an alcove located on the square's west side.

==Notes==
*Despite being an armorer, his standard greeting is "top notch swords!"

==Bugs==
*It is possible that the armorer may be absent from his shop during working hours. Meditating for some amount of time may cause him to return. Note that this is a persistent bug that affects several armorers and blacksmiths in the game.
