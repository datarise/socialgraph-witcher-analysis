'''Anselm''' was a merchant working in conjunction with his business partner [[Griswold]].

==Biography==
In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Anselm, along with Griswold, his business partner, traveled to [[Velen]] from an unspecified place to trade with [[Phillip Strenger]], the Bloody Baron, having deemed the venture worthwhile due to the lack of competition in the area. The merchants hired a number of mercenary guards to keep them safe in the war-torn lands of Velen, however, the guards themselves turned on the merchants after the group were out of sight of any settlements. [[Geralt of Rivia]] encountered the bandit guards attacking Anselm and Griswold on the road south of [[Mulbrydale]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt saved the merchants}} Anselm and Griswold completed their plan by traveling to [[Crow's Perch]], and began trading with the locals there, out of a stall near the main gate.

*[[Caravan Attack]]

== Notes ==
* It can take awhile for him to show up at Crow's Perch (roughly a week).
** There's also a possibility that him showing up is tied to another quest (like doing [[Forefathers' Eve]]).
