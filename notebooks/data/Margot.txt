'''Margot''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. She is the proprietor of the [[Flotsam brothel|brothel]] in [[Flotsam]].

Geralt meets her during the [[By the Gods - Stringing Up Sods|execution]] in the City Square of Flotsam. She mocks [[Bernard Loredo]] and his men and in this way helps Geralt to save his friends, [[Zoltan Chivay]] and [[Dandelion]]. Later on, during the "[[Hung Over]]" quest, she recounts to Geralt what happened during the night at the brothel, while Roche's men and he were drunk.

You can commonly find her in the first room on the right after entering the brothel, on the lower level of the [[Flotsam inn|inn]].

If he loots her room, Geralt also find some [[Margot's notes|notes]]. It turns out that not only does Margot have suspicions about [[Síle de Tansarville]], but that she is a Scoia'tael collaborator too.

Margot likes to peep at people through a hole in the wall of her lover [[Derae]]'s room. While this is not a nice habit, it turns out to be very helpful when Geralt looks for [[Triss]], at the end of Chapter I.

If Geralt gives [[Iorveth]] his sword in Chapter I during "[[The Assassins of Kings]]", Margot later offers him a [[Margot's letter to Iorveth|letter to Iorveth]]. If he does not return Iorveth's sword, Margot kills herself and you can read her intentions in a [[Margot's farewell letter|farewell letter]].
