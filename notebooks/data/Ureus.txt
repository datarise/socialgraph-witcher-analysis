'''Ureus''' is a huge and ancient [[cemetaur]]. [[Tobias Hoffman]] will pay generously for her [[The Witcher trophy quests|head]].

She can be found in the [[crypt in the fields]] behind a wall. Be prepared to fight before using Aard to break down that wall! Quite a few other monsters guard the path there.
