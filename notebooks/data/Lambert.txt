'''Lambert''' was a [[witcher]] from the [[School of the Wolf]], active in the 13th century.

Trained by [[Vesemir]], he was known for his biting tongue, and was often rude in conversation, particularly towards [[Triss Merigold]], addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He did not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality.

He was described as being at the same age as [[Coën]] and one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of [[Kaer Morhen]].

==Biography==
{{Canon Marker|Type=Games}}
In {{Year|year=1232|canon=no}}, Lambert was at a [[Camp near Kaer Morhen|camp]] in the Kaer Morhen valley, dealing with an [[archespore]] problem, and protecting the keep from possible attackers.<ref name="pon">{{PN}}</ref>
{{Canon Marker End|Type=Games}}

In the autumn of {{Year|year=1267|canon=yes}}, Lambert went to Kaer Morhen to wait out the winter, along with Vesemir, Coën and [[Eskel]]. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] arrived one day with [[Ciri]], and wished to train her at the keep, which Lambert spent time helping with, especially in the ways of sword combat on the [[Kaer Morhen training equipment|pendulum]]. After Triss Merigold arrived at the keep, he spent many a moment arguing with her, referring to her only as "Merigold", to her annoyance.<ref name="boe">{{BoE}}</ref>

=={{tw1}}==
Lambert appears in the main campaign of {{Tw1}}, as well as {{PN}}. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a [[Savolla|wizard]], Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.

In {{Tw1}}, he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.

:''The young witcher I met at Kaer Morhen sure is quarrelsome and he has a biting tongue... He is rude, especially to Triss Merigold, who he addresses by her last name. I think at times he uses rudeness to express his fondness for someone.''

=={{PN}}==
In "''The Price of Neutrality''", he can be found staking out the ford nearest the camp, keeping the local archespore in check and making sure the unexpected guests do not suddenly try to enter the keep.

== {{tw3}} ==
'''Lambert''' is back in the third installment of The Witcher Series and seems to have a deep seated jealousy towards Geralt, as Geralt is an extremely famous and beloved witcher, while Lambert considers his witcher status a cruel twist of fate, and is stuck hunting relatively benign monsters for people who hate witchers.

Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.

=== Later life ===
Geralt had a dream in the May of {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, in which he practised training at Kaer Morhen. When he and Ciri walked down to the lower courtyard, they trained with [[Eskel]] and Lambert, or more specificially Lambert trained with Eskel, Vesemir with Geralt and Ciri with a [[Kaer Morhen training equipment|training dummy]].
[[File:Witcher-3-7.png|thumb|240x240px|Eskel and Lambert at Kaer Morhen keep]]
During Geralt's travels looking for Ciri, he could encounter Lambert after taking an ekimmara contract. After they had slain the ekimmara, they got to chatting, and Geralt helped track down three members of [[Jad Karadin]]'s band, [[Vienne]], [[Lund]] and [[Hammond]]. After they hunted the three down, they hunted down Jad, and confronted him. Geralt could choose to help Lambert kill him or he could stay out of it.

After Geralt arrived back to Kaer Morhen, after investigating all leads on Ciri, with [[Uma]], he went with Lambert to the [[Circle of Elements]] to repair the phylactery. On the way they encountered several problems, such as [[Rock troll|trolls]] and [[foglet]]s. Lambert later participated in [[The Battle of Kaer Morhen]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt got to Lambert in time to save him from the Wild Hunt}} Geralt and Lambert fought the Wild Hunt side-by-side, and both survived the battle.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt didn't get to Lambert in time}} Geralt didn't arrive in time to save Lambert and so he died to the Wild Hunt. After the battle was finished they had a funeral in his honor.

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt convinced Keira Metz to go to Kaer Morhen}} During the battle Lambert was rescued from the Wild Hunt by [[Keira Metz]] and soon after got into a relationship with the [[sorceress]]

=== Journal Entry ===
:''If destiny truly chooses which boys become witchers, then in Lambert's case it had made a twisted, cruel choice. After hearing his story, Geralt had to admit that Lambert had every reason to be unenthused about the lot fate had granted him.''
:''A chance encounter of two witchers hunting the same ekimmara turned into a tale of old friendship, murder, and vengeance. The moral of the story? Don't mess with Lambert.''
:''Though Lambert made no secret of his hatred for Kaer Morhen, when the time came to stand in its defense, he did so without a second thought.''
:'''If Keira didn't go to Kaer Morhen and Geralt didn't save Lambert in time:'''
::''Sadly, during the battle, Lambert found himself overwhelmed by enemy forces. Relief came too late and he was cut down by the Wild Hunt's soldiers.''
:'''If Geralt convinced Keira to come to Kaer Morhen:'''
::''During this battle, he came within a hair's breadth of losing his life. Luckily, Keira arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers.''
::''It just might be that Lambert and Keira's later (and somewhat unexpected) relationship came about as a result of that moment, when they fought for survival at each other's side. It is also possible it was a simple matter of two attractive people taking a liking to each other. At any rate, only time could tell what would become of the couple.''
