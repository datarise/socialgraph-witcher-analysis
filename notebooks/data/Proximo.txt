'''Proximo Woodblade''' was the arena master of the arena in the [[Kaedweni camp]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1271}}.

== Biography ==
Proximo was responsible for the fighting in the arena, which was a form of entertainment which very much pleased [[King]] [[Henselt]]. He was also responsible for the reward offered in an announcement he posted on the [[notice board]] for getting rid of the [[rotfiend]]s which plagued the areas around the camp.

== Journal Entry ==
:''Proximo, the arena master, had a talent for oration and the fights he organized were famous in all of [[Kaedwen]] and beyond. Blows rained down, armor fragments and teeth flew left and right – in other words, the audience found his arena to be equal to the merry dancing of a fair day.''
