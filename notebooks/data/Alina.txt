'''Alina''' was a young girl from [[Murky Waters]] and the daughter of the village chief, [[Tobias Hoffman]]. She was to be married to [[Julian]], a rich merchant from [[Kovir]], much to the disgust of her jealous sister [[Celina]] and the poet [[Adam (Murky Waters)|Adam]], who was secretly in love with her.

She can initially be found in her [[Alina's house|house]] in the village of Murky Waters. Later, once she becomes a [[noonwraith]], she usually hangs out near the ruin mill in the [[Fields]].

She seemed strangely resigned to marrying Julian and appeared fond of him, at least in a way, but she also showed no intention whatsoever of ending her affair with Adam which she carried on every day at noon, in the [[raspberry patch]] in the fields. She did seem jealous of Celina's attempts to gain Julian's attention, even though this last endeavor was proving fruitless.

She had also developed quite an attachment to [[Alvin]]. She would have dearly loved to have adopted him and raise him with Julian, but Julian was not so taken with the prospect of raising a child who was, from all reports, a [[source]].

The jealous rivalry with her sister reached a peak one day when Celina started to argue with her, near the Raspberry patch, and ended up pushing Alina down and causing Alina to hit her head on a rock, killing her instantly. Because she was murdered in this manner, Alina arised as a noonwraith, doomed to forever roam the fields.
