'''Sukrus''' was a [[mercenary]] from [[Skellige]] living in [[Novigrad]] around {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}.

==Biography==
Sometime prior to 1272, he worked for [[Éibhear Hattori]], but when he asked the [[elf]] for extra payment, the elf didn't give him any and the two parted ways.

Sukrus's sister, meanwhile, had married a merchant who convinced Sukrus to help bring Skellige mead over and they'd earn a nice profit. However, when Sukrus did all the heavy work and got it to Novigrad, the brother-in-law started bringing up additional overhead costs, refusing to pay anything out to Sukrus. Eventually, the two had a "chat" at [[The Golden Sturgeon]] where they were busying fistfighting one another over the payment.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt intervenes and helps Sukrus}} Still mad and with the brother-in-law knocked out now, Sukrus turned to the next closest person, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], and the two had a brawl before one of them was defeated. However, like a typical Skelliger, Sukrus invited the [[witcher]] in for a drink and to patch things up and offered his services if the witcher would help him deal with his brother-in-law.

Once Geralt helped him get even with his brother-in-law, Sukrus readily agreed to be Hattori's bodyguard, who paid off his debt as well to the Skelliger, smoothing things over. A short time later, Hattori asked him and Geralt to help "recover" some supplies from one of [[Ernst van Hoorn]]'s warehouses, and thus Sukrus headed out to scout the area.

Shortly after Geralt came out of the warehouse, van Hoorn and some bandits appeared, along with his brother-in-law. However, when van Hoorn threatened Sukrus, his brother-in-law sided with Sukrus.

:{{Condition|Text = If Gearlt runs off during the fight}} Unfortunately, Sukrus was overwhelmed by the bandits and was likely killed.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps during the fight}} With the witcher's help, the three fought off the bandits. Afterwards, he and his brother-in-law made amends and, before van Hoorn could regain conscious, bound him up to be sent to Skellige.
