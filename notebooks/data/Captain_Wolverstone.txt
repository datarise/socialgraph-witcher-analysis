'''Wolverstone''' was the captain of the ''[[Atropos]]'', serving routes between [[Novigrad]] and [[Skellige]].

In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he was the only person willing to take [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to Skellige, as all the other captains at the [[Novigrad Docks]] deemed the journey too risky. Wolverstone demanded a fee of 1000{{Crown}} for passage, owing to the lack of competition and the risks associated with the trip. In his usual style, he began the trip intoxicated.

On its approach into [[Kaer Trolde Harbor]], the ''Atropos'' was boarded by pirates of [[Clan an Craite]]. This, combined with terrible weather, led to the ship veering off course south towards [[Rannvaig]], near which it wrecked, leading to Wolverstone's death.

==Notes==
*It is possible to reclaim the 1000 {{Crown}} passage fee by looting Wolverstone's body near the shipwreck.

==Trivia==
*He is likely a reference to Edward Wolverstone, who also commandeers a ship named ''Atropos'' in the novel ''[[wikipedia:Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' by [[wikipedia:Rafael Sabatini|Rafael Sabatini]].
