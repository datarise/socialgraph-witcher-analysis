'''Teyu''' was a renegade [[vodyanoy]] [[priest|cleric]].

== Biography ==
In summer {{Year|canon=no|year=1270}}, Teyu and his warriors began to attack defenseless people of [[Murky Waters]] in nearby [[fields]]. In order to stop him, the village chief [[Tobias Hoffman]] offered payment for his head.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt kills Teyu}} Eventually [[Geralt of Rivia]] killed them and, after showing the proof, received his reward.

* [[The Vodyan Priest]]

== Notes ==

* Teyu is unique among all [[The Witcher trophy quests|trophy quests]] as he is the only one who should be fought using a steel sword instead of silver.
** Even [[Voref]] who being a wolf normally should be fought with a steel sword is actually susceptible to silver.
* He may also be the only trophy monster that has the ability to reason, unless [[Lilly]] does too.
