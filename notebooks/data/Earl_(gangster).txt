}}'''Earl''' and his associate, [[Duke (gangster)|Duke]], were self-proclaimed crime bosses in [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

==Background==
After [[Whoreson Junior]]'s fall from fame, the duo sought to capitalize on the newly opened vacancy in Novigrad's underworld. One of their ventures was the collection of rare, expensive [[gwent]] cards, usually through intimidation and coercion, which got them into a spat with [[Zoltan Chivay]], who also wanted such cards in order to pay off his debt to the [[Francis Bedlam|King of Beggars]].

=={{Tw3}}==
In [[A Dangerous Game]], Geralt meets Earl outside the [[Rosemary and Thyme]], where he and Duke attempt to intimidate Zoltan into ceasing his search for highly sought-after gwent cards. While Earl is belligerent, Geralt's presence seems to deter Duke from escalating the matter, and the two leave.

Later Earl, along with another gang member, intimidates [[Ravvy]] at [[the Golden Sturgeon]], and again encounters Geralt who wishes to obtain Ravvy's gwent card for Zoltan. Earl offers him the chance to play gwent for Ravvy's life. If Geralt wins, Ravvy survives and hands over the card, while the gangsters leave. If he loses the game, or outright refuses to play, Geralt slays Earl and his associate, but not before Ravvy is stabbed to death.
