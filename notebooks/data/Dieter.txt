'''Dieter''' was a former stable hand of Lord [[Ignatius Verrieres]] and served alongside [[Mislav]] at the [[Amavet Fortress Ruins|castle]].

He discovered Mislav's secret relationship with the lord's son, [[Florian Verrieres|Florian]], after walking in on the couple in the stables, and outed them to the lord. This led to Mislav being banished from the castle and village, Florian hanging himself, and the grief-stricken lord letting the estate fall into ruin.

In May of {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Dieter was killed by wild [[dog]]s and his body was discovered by [[Geralt of Rivia]] and Mislav while the [[witcher]] investigated the [[Griffin (creature)|griffin]] attacks in [[White Orchard]].
