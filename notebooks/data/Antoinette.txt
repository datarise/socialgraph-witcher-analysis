}}'''Antoinette''' was a noblewoman from [[Beauclair]], [[Toussaint]], that Geralt meets after his audience with the [[King Foltest|King]] at the [[Foltest's castle|Royal castle]] in the original game.

== {{Tw1}} ==
At the beginning of [[:Category:The Witcher Chapter V|Chapter V]]. Her cousins, [[Buse]], [[Corbin]] and [[Ramerot]] are in hiding in the [[Refugees' caves|refugee caves]] in the [[swamp cemetery]] after incurring the disfavour of the king and they are completely out of [[oren]]s.

When Geralt speaks to Antoinette, she mentions that she recognizes Geralt because in her home many years ago, she saw him dancing all night with [[Fringilla Vigo|a sorceress]] that he was very fond of.

Geralt doubts this due to his inability to dance. Antoinette questions if all Witcher's have white hair; Geralt says he is the only one, and she says she must be confused because she remembers him dancing with a sorceress.
