'''{{PAGENAME}}''' was a villager from [[White Orchard]] who lived on a [[Vildenvert's farm|farm]] with his family, just east of White Orchard village.

==Biography==
In early {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Dune managed to avoid being drafted into the [[Temerian Army]] by purposely injuring himself, unlike his brother [[Bastien Vildenvert|Bastien]]. When [[Temeria]]n and [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] forces clashed on a [[Battlefield (White Orchard)|battlefield]] during the [[Battle of White Orchard]], Bastien went missing and Dune posted [[Brother Missing|a notice]] on the White Orchard [[notice board]], requesting help in finding his brother, as he wanted to find his brother alive or, at the very least, give his brother a proper burial.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps him find his brother}} they found Bastien along with a Nilfgaardian soldier, [[Rhosyn]], and Bastien explained how both were wounded in the battle and helped each other to find shelter in a small hut in the woods. Dune, however, didn't want to take in the Nilfgaardian deserter.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt convinced him to take in Rhosyn}} Dune was able to disguise the deserter and all of them tended to their family farm.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't convince him to take in Rhosyn}} Dune returned to his family farm with his brother, leaving the deserter to die in the abandoned hut.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt found the brother before talking to Dune}} Dune went and gathered his brother but, with nobody there to speak up for Rhosyn, he left the deserter to die.
