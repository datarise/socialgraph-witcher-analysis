== Journal Entry ==
: ''Every military camp has uses for a blacksmith – from shoeing [[horse]]s, to making and repairing weapons, to freeing the wounded from warped armor after a battle. Magnus was a reliable artisan, a huge man with the strength of a bull. Rumor had it that his grip was not unlike that of iron pincers.''
