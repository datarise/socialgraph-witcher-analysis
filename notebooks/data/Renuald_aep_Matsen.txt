'''Renuald aep Matsen''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He appears if [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] chooses to rescue Triss instead of [[Anais La Valette]] or [[Philippa]]. He is also seen together with [[Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen]] in the decompression of [[Triss]] cutscene ([[Iorveth]]'s path). On [[Roche]]'s path, he can be seen training his soldiers near [[Loc Muinne]]'s market square, in [[Chapters|Chapter III]].

=== Journal Entry ===
:''Just as ambassador [[Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen]] was the Emperor's mouth here in the North, Renuald aep Matsen was his iron-clad fist. One look at this stern warrior's face was enough to instill a justified respect. He and his ilk became symbols of [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] power when black standards and cloaks fluttered together with the tramp of the cavalry's hooves and the clash of arms in battle. The veterans from the [[Impera|Impera brigade]] were famed for their fanatical loyalty to the Emperor, and Matsen was no exception in that regard. He carried out his ruler's every order without question.''
: '''If Geralt chooses to rescue [[Triss]] during Chapter III:'''
::''Guided by loyalty to the same power, Renuald followed the orders he had received and sent Shilard to the beyond without blinking an eye.''
::''Yet the witcher made sure that Matsen embarked upon the same journey not long after the ambassador.''

=== Associated Quests ===

==Notes==
* It is stated in journal entry, that he was a member of [[Impera]] brigade. He also uses a shield with the Impera brigade salamander symbol in game, which seems to confirm this.
* He was the one holding [[Assire var Anahid]] when Shilard had murdered her.
* He was the one who brought [[Letho]] to the mage summit along with Shilard, if Geralt didn't kill him.
* It seems that Shilard didn't trust him, as he states in one of his [[Ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen's second letter to the Emperor|letters]] addressed to the [[Emhyr var Emreis|Emperor]].
* In {{Tw3}}, there is a [[gwent]] card that [[Renuald aep Matsen (gwent card)|bears his name]].
