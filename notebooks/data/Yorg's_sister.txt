'''Yorg's sister''' (name unknown) was living in the village of [[Rogne]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} with her family.

== Biography ==
She told her brother, [[Yorg]], that their uncle, [[Gretter]], had molested her, sending Yorg flying into a rage and ended up killing the uncle. He was then sentenced to death by being chained to a rock out at sea. However, it turned out she'd lied about Gretter, having simply not liked him and thought he stank. After her brother was sentenced to death, she became upset, not realizing the ramifications of her lie could lead to.

She later attended the mourning for her uncle but became upset when the others said Yorg was a vile criminal and ran off.
