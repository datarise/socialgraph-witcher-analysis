==Biography==
Hanna was married to the hunter [[Niellen]], with whom she lived in Blackbough along with Hanna's sister, [[Margrit]]. Unbeknownst to Hanna, her husband was in fact a [[werewolf]] who secluded himself in the forest during full moons to avoid harming any of the local populace.<ref>[[Mysterious notes]]</ref> However, Margrit was incredibly jealous of Hanna's relationship with Niellen, even after she'd learned of Niellen's lycanthropy. Thus, on one of the nights when Niellen transformed, Margrit led Hanna deep into the woods in the hopes that her sister would see Niellen for what he really is and leave him. Tragically, Niellen, while in werewolf form, in a blind bloodlust, ripped Hanna to shreds while Margrit ran off.
