'''Folan''' was a [[Skellige]]r warrior from [[Clan Tuirseach]], and a companion of [[Hjalmar]] during the expedition to slay the [[ice giant]] [[Myrhyff]].

== Biography ==
Since childhood, Folan was a friend of both [[Hjalmar an Craite|Hjalmar]] and [[Cerys an Craite|Cerys]], the children of the [[Clan an Craite|an Craites]]' leader, [[Crach an Craite|Crach]].

In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Folan signed on to Hjalmar's crew to slay Myrhyff, the ice giant who had taken over [[Undvik]] a year prior, and forced out nearly all of the island's population. Following King [[Bran Tuirseach|Bran]]'s death, this expedition against Myrhyff was Hjalmar's attempt at a heroic deed, one which would allow him to make a claim for Skellige's throne. Thus the warriors who joined the expedition, Folan included, travelled to Undvik.

On Undvik, the group encamped and Folan was assigned to night watch. While on duty, he spotted Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's [[Hornwall horn]], which the jarl's son used to drive away [[siren]]s. Folan then chased Egnar across the island, all the while shooting the thief with arrows. The pursuit continued through a [[nekker]] lair near an [[Abandoned Village (Undvik)|abandoned village]], and ended when, eventually, Folan caught up with Egnar, who screamed and attracted the attention of some [[ice troll]]s from a nearby cave.

While Egnar died from injuries inflicted upon him by the arrows, the trolls kidnapped Folan and placed him into a cauldron intending to use him for a stew. Some time later, when Folan was about to be cooked, [[Geralt of Rivia]] arrived on Undvik searching for Hjalmar and the missing crew.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt did not find Folan}} It is unknown exactly what became of Folan, though it is likely that he was killed and consumed by the ice trolls that kidnapped him.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt found and saved Folan}} Geralt followed the trail of footsteps and blood left by Folan's pursuit of Egnar, and came upon the cave where Folan was being held. Either by killing the trolls, or solving their riddle, Geralt freed Folan whose skin had turned very red from the heat of the cauldron. Folan then accompanied the [[witcher]] on the search for Hjalmar, which eventually led them to the [[Dorve Ruins]]. Assuming he did not perish up to that point, Folan helped Hjalmar and Geralt defeat Myrhyff.

Later, Folan joined yet another foray organized by Hjalmar an Craite, this time to provide help to Geralt and his friends in battling the [[Wild Hunt]] at [[Kaer Morhen]].

== Journal Entry ==
: ''Many brave warriors answered Hjalmar's call to join him in reconquering Undvik from the Ice Giant. Among them -Folan, son of Ulf, Hjalmar's frequent comrade in battle and dear childhood friend. Folan, a member of Clan Tuirseach, was a fearless sailor and an unequaled archer, and so did not hesitate to join his dangerous expedition that stood to shower him in glory.''
: ''It would have ended horribly for him, however, had the witcher not kept his wits about him and saved him from the clutches of hungry trolls by winning a riddle contest.''
: ''Folan proved his skill with a bow by riddling the Ice Giant with arrows during the final fight against the colossus, a deed recounted to this day during Kaer Trolde feasts.''
