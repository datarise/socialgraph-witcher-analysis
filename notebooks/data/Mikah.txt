'''Mikah''' was a peasant from [[White Orchard]].

== Biography ==
In May {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he and his friend, [[Dromle]], were having a drink at the [[White Orchard inn]] when the [[witcher]]s [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Vesemir]] passed through in their search for [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt approaches the two}} Dromle showed obvious contempt towards the witcher, telling Geralt to leave and how he was ruining their drink, and Mikah joined in with some insults of his own.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt uses Axii on Mikah}} Mikah, under the influence of [[Axii]], answered Geralt that they hadn't seen or heard of such a woman. Dromle tried to attract attention form the others over this [[Magic|witchcraft]] but quieted down when Geralt threatened him.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt simply presses on them to answer}} Dromle finally answered the question, stating they haven't seen or heard of such a woman.

== Notes ==
* Speaking to Mikah and Dromle is completely optional, as speaking to [[Gaunter O'Dimm]], is the only patron required to speak to Geralt to advance the quest.
