'''Yontek''' was said to be biggest fool in the village of [[Lurtch]] located in central [[Velen]]. Despite this, he wasn't greedy like the other villagers, which actually resulted him being the only one not turned into a pig when the rest stole from an underground altar.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Fools' Gold]]

== Notes ==
* He can be found sometimes with his hand glowing and waving it around, suggesting he is capable of magic. However, this could just be a bug or an oversight.
