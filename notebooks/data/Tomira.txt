'''Tomira''' was the local [[herbalist]] of [[White Orchard]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

== Biography ==
When Tomira was 18 years old, she was taken in by Mother [[Nenneke]] to become a healer. However, there was a young man named Goslav that all the novices, including Tomira, couldn't keep their eyes off of at work and Tomira ended up leaving the [[Temple of Melitele (Ellander)|temple]] for him. The two spent a summer together but then Goslav left and when Tomira tried to return to the temple, Nenneke refused to take her back. Her own parents refused to say a word to her as well and simply gave her a travel cloak and a small coin pouch.

Tomira traveled for a long time, trying to find a place that was both safe and where she felt she was needed and finally ended up in White Orchard. At one point she befriended another villager in the area, [[Claer]], and the two became close friends until Claer's untimely death.

In 1272, during the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] invasion, White Orchard had its own problems in the form of a [[Griffin (creature)|griffin]], which was attacking people on the roads. One such woman, [[Lena]], was gravely injured and brought to Tomira's [[Tomira's hut|hut]] to try and heal her. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything else Tomira could do for Lena other than try to make her as comfortable as possible until she succumbed to her wounds.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Lena}} she thanked the [[witcher]] "for giving a damn" and gave him a small gift in return. Later, if the witcher returned and asked about Lena, she explained that Nilfgaardian soldiers showed up and took her but doesn't know where to or why.

{{Condition|Text = If Nilfgaard wins the war}} Tomira lived out her days in White Orchard as she supplied herbs to the local peasants under Nilfgaard's rule.

{{Condition|Text = If Redania wins the war}} [[Radovid V|Radovid]] hunted down all the [[mage]]s, herbalists, and [[alchemist]]s and killed them. When [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] came back to White Orchard, he found Tomira's hut ablaze and her tied to a stake, prepared to be burned by a group of [[witch hunter]]s. He saved Tomira, and she traveled far away, to escape Radovid and his wild groups of witch hunters.
