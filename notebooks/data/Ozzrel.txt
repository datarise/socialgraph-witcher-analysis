'''Ozzrel''' is a very large, named [[alghoul]]. Kill him and take his [[The Witcher trophy quests|head]] to the [[Royal huntsman]] to receive 200 {{oren}} in addition to some experience points.

Ozzrel is found in the [[crypt in the outskirts]], but only on a second visit having completed [[Buried Memories]] for [[Mikul]].

== Associated Quest ==
* [[King of the Crypt]]

== Notes ==
* Talking to the Royal Huntsman is not required to unlock the secondary area of the crypt and gain access to Ozzrel (i.e. you need only complete [[Buried Memories]]).
* Ozzrel can be a difficult foe, but he does turn his back which is a good time to strike.
* Using potions and oil can also help defeat him more quickly.
* If you have difficulties beating him, then Igni hit-and-run tactic can be useful. Especially if it is boosted by Place of Power and Circle.
* There is no need to kill him while he is in the room where he is found. He can be led to a more well-lit area, which can be better than holding a torch if a torch is being used to see in the dark.
* His head is not the only prize in his room. After he is defeated, make sure to get the [[Red meteorite ore|Red Meteorite ore]].
