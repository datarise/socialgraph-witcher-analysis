'''{{PAGENAME}}''', also known as '''the Visitor''', was the [[general]] of the [[Kaedweni Army|Kaedweni forces]] in the second [[Lormark War|war]] between [[Kaedwen]] and [[Aedirn]].

During that war, [[King]] [[Henselt]]'s troops, including the dreaded [[Dun Banner]], crossed the [[Pontar (river)|Pontar]] the third day after the autumn equinox. Aedirn, led by [[Seltkirk]], had good spies however so they were ready for the Kaedwenis whom they proceeded to annihilate.

Vandergrift cut Seltkirk off from the rest of his army. The two met in the middle of the melee. It was a battle of titans. In the end, the Visitor hacked Seltkirk and sliced the white knight from his head to his groin. A terrible death that sent the Aedirnian ranks into disarray.

During the battle, Vandergrift's long simmering disdain of [[Sabrina Glevissig]] came to a head and the two argued bitterly which led the sorceress to retaliate by summoning [[Melgar's Fire]] and causing balls of fire to rain down on Kaedweni and Aedirnian combatants alike.

Earlier, in peacetime, Seltkirk and Vandergrift had met at a tournament in [[Ard Carraigh]]. Seltkirk won then. Vandergrift's sword cracked and the Visitor had to yield. In response, Vandergrift had the smith who had forged the sword hanged, and commissioned a new sword forged by the best smiths and mages in Kaedwen. He named this new sword "[[Commander's sword|Loa'then]]", meaning "hatred", and continued to wield this sword until his death on the battlefield near [[Vergen]], where he was one of the approximately 3,000 soldiers burned to death by Sabrina Gelvissig's fireballs. Loa'then was later salvaged from the battlefield, and later came into the possession of [[Saesenthessis|Saskia the Dragonslayer]], the leader of the Aedirnian resistance to Kaedwen's latest attempt to annex [[Upper Aedirn]]. Saskia later gave the sword to [[Geralt of Rivia]] to use to break the curse laid on the battlefield from three years earlier, during which Geralt fought and defeated Vandergrift in the form of a [[Draug]].

In {{tw2}}, Vandergrift only appears as the arch-wraith Draug.

== Notes ==
He was given the nickname "''the Visitor''" because he used to visit at night the inhabitants of a conquered city in their houses, calm them by assuring them they have nothing to fear, and then promptly cut their throats.<ref>The Witcher 2 localisation glossary</ref>
