== {{Tw1}} ==
[[Golan Vivaldi]] says Vimme is his cousin. He also mentions that Vimme ''"once met a [[witcher]], a debt collector, apparently"''.

== {{Tw3}} ==
Vimme runs the [[Vivaldi Bank]]'s branch situated in Novigrad's [[Hierarch Square]]. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can use services to exchange [[Currency|currencies]] or borrow a loan. The dwarf is also an experienced [[gwent]] player, with an enviable deck which includes the "[[Vesemir (gwent card)|Vesemir]]" card.

=== Exchange rates ===
* The rate of exchange for [[oren]]s to [[crown]]s is one-to-one.
* The rate of exchange for [[floren]]s to crowns is one-to-three.

=== Journal Entry ===
: ''The dwarves have been in the banking business since the legendary [[King]] [[Dezmod|Desmond]] of [[Temeria]] was just a snot-nosed brat in short trousers asking for me "yam" with his "bwed." Since then, the prominent dwarven banking families – the [[Giancardi family|Giancardis]], the [[Vivaldi family|Vivaldis]] and the [[Cianfanelli family|Cianfanellis]] – have only expanded their services, establishing branches in all the larger cities of the [[Northern Kingdoms|North]].''
: ''Vimme Vivaldi carried the torch of this venerable tradition into modern times, growing the Novigrad branch of his family's bank until it was the largest in the city. Geralt and I met him over a dozen years before our story begins and had always appreciated his honesty and acumen.''
: ''The latter he gave further proof of during the time in which our story takes place, for his bank remained profitable even in the face of growing nonhuman oppression.''
