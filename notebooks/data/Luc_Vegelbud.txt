'''Luc Vegelbud''', [[Albert Vegelbud|Albert]]'s cousin, is the black sheep of the [[Vegelbud family]] and a horse racer, whose steed is named "Succubus". His aunt, [[Ingrid Vegelbud|Ingrid]], particularly dislikes him and wants to see him fail.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Race: The Great Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby]]

== Notes ==
* It's not exactly clear on how he's related to the Vegelbud family. He's described as Albert's cousin, therefore one of his parents must be a sibling of Ingrid, but there's no mention of [[Patricia Vegelbud|Patricia]] having other children.
