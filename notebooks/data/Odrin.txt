'''Odrin''' was a [[Kaedwen]]i soldier in {{Year|canon=no|year=1271}} but preferred to spend his time drinking to the point he had a famous reputation for it and "having a good time."

== Biography ==
Sometime after Kaedwen fell to [[Redania]], he fled and ended up at one point near [[White Orchard]] in [[Temeria]], where he briefly enlisted with the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardians]] that were stationed there.<ref>[[Notice board (White Orchard)#Wanted: Deserter|Notice board (White Orchard) - Wanted: Deserter]]</ref> For two days he proceeded to drink and eat enough for several people before deserting and making his way to [[Velen]]. While he was at the [[Border Post]] for a time, he complained about not finding a single drop of alcohol<ref>[[Notice board (Border Post)#Help, Good People!|Notice board (Border Post) - Help, Good People!]]</ref> before eventually making his way further north into [[Novigrad]] and [[Redania]].

Throughout the region he pulled off a number of shenanigans, from claiming he was an [[Oxenfurt Academy]] graduate,<ref>[[Notice board (Oxenfurt)#Beware Of Frauds!|Notice board (Oxenfurt) - Beware Of Frauds!]]</ref> staying at an inn without paying,<ref>[[Notice board (Seven Cats Inn)#Warning!|Notice board (Seven Cats Inn) - Warning!]]</ref> stealing mead in Novigrad,<ref>[[Beware Of Thief!|Notice board - Beware of Thief!]]</ref> or just being a terrible house guest.<ref>[[Notice board (Brunwich)#Thief! Robber!|Notice board (Brunwich) - Thief! Robber!]]</ref> Despite all this, he felt he was quite the lady's man and even put up a posting that he'd keep any woman company.<ref>[[Notice board (Alness)#Matron Pleaser|Notice board (Alness) - Matron Pleaser]]</ref> He could eventually be found passed out from drinking in Novigrad's [[Silverton]] district, near the harbors. By {{Year|canon = no|year = 1275}}, he'd even made his way to [[Toussaint]] and tried to make money by leading people to see "immodest" displays of women.<ref>[[Notice board (The Gran'place)#Good Folk!|Notice board (The Gran'place) - Good Folk!]]</ref>

When Geralt first gets to the [[Kaedweni camp]], he notices a trio of drunken soldiers who all seem to be searching for "Odrin". When he asks about this "Odrin", one soldier tells him simply, "you'll know him when you see him".

A while later, Geralt leaves the camp through the southwestern gate and wanders down to the beach below where he finds Odrin, passed out in front of a [[Cave under the Kaedweni camp|cave]].

=== Journal Entry ===
:''To say that Odrin was not shy about drinking is like saying that Iorveth was not shy about shooting humans. Such was his reputation as a drunkard that wherever moonshine could be smelt in Henselt's camp, one assumed that Odrin could not be far off.''
:''A secret, or a full mug of beer – keeping one is easy enough. Keeping both is another matter altogether. During an alcohol-fueled conversation, the soldier provided much interesting information. Given his passion for drink, I was surprised that Odrin had managed to keep the secret for so long. His reputation as a mighty drinker was well deserved, but as a conspirator he was a flop.''

=={{Tw3}}==
Odrin is mentioned in numerous notice board postings in all regions where notice boards can be found. The man himself is found lying on a small dock in the [[Silverton]] district of [[Novigrad]], where Odrin and his companions have set up a small business named "Odrin & Friends – Bottlemen". Next to Odrin is a [[Merchant (Silverton docks)|merchant]] with hundreds of [[empty bottle]]s for sale.

== Notes ==
* According to game files, Odrin was supposed to appear in the [[Bald Mountain (quest)|Bald Mountain]] quest in {{Tw3}}.
