'''Vinson Traut''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}.

Geralt first hears about Vinson Traut when asking questions about [[Seltkirk's armor]].

Later, while on the trail of the conspirators using the [[square coin]]s, Geralt gains access to a trap door in the back of the prostitutes' tent in the [[camp followers' encampment]]. Below the tent, he finds the underground chambers of the [[old tower]] and inside, the man in a room with several henchmen. The two can fight it out, in which case Traut's remains contain the magical armor, an [[A Hog Named Henselt|anti-Henselt pamplet]], a [[Conspirators' hideout key|key]] and some other loot

== Journal Entry ==
:''The owner of Seltkirk's armor was an officer in [[Henselt]]'s army. Suspected as an accessory to the conspiracy against the king's life, Vinson Traut was hiding somewhere.''
:''Though Geralt wanted to solve things amicably, Vinson was less than eager to cooperate. On top of that, he decided to commit a fancy form of suicide – by attacking the witcher. Left with no choice, Geralt sent him to the great beyond.''
