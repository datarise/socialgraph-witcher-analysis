'''Bogut Kuternoga''' seems to be an early [[fence]] sketch. He is a character which was conceived, but not implemented, for {{Tw1}} computer game. The sources of the items he sells including weapons, armour and jewellery are very suspicious. He would have wandered the streets of [[Vizima]] having no fixed address.

== Notes ==
"''Kuternoga''" translates to "lame duck" in Polish.
