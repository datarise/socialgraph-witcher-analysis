'''Folmer''' was a warrior from [[Ard Skellig]], who can be encountered in the [[Kaer Trolde|town]] under the [[Kaer Trolde citadel]], with another warrior advising his friend [[Ruar]] to not eat so much, as he would likely be in pain and thus unable to go raiding otherwise.

== Notes ==
* Folmer does not have his own model and will appear in the form of a random warrior.
