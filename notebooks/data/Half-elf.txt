A '''half-elf''' is a child of a [[human]] and an [[elf]] or of two half-elves. Half-elves inherit characteristics of both their parent races, but are treated with distrust and often contempt by both elves and humans. A human with a quarter of elven blood is called a [[quarter-elf]].

== Appearance ==
Like humans and elves, half-elves vary by appearance, with some easier to detect their half-blood status than others. For example, the half-elf [[Schirrú]] was commonly referred to as a half-elf before his name was even known to others, with a dead giveaway being his eyes: large, almond-shaped, and yellow-green.<ref name="ttots">{{TTotS}}</ref> However, others, like [[Beatrix of Kovir]], were said to display almost none of their elven heritage and even by human standards she was considered ugly.<ref name="bof">{{BoF}}</ref>

==History==
In the years following {{Year|year=1263|canon=yes}}, many half-elves chose to support the [[Scoia'tael]], due to the prejudice growing related to [[nonhuman]]s. While some volunteered to join their ranks, others simply chose to provide shelter and food for the guerilla forces.<ref name="boe">{{BoE}}</ref>

== Notable Half-elves ==
* [[Cerro]]
* [[Civril]]
* [[Gardik]]
* [[Maria Pulcheria]]
* [[Riannon]]
* [[Schirrú]]
* [[Vratimir]]
* [[Xymena de Sepulveda]]

During the quest "[[A Ghost Story]]", Geralt rescues a half-elf from a gang of thugs who have been holding her against her will in an [[Haunted house|abandoned house]] in the slums of the [[Temple Quarter]]. The following journal entry is the direct result of this rescue and its subsequent reward.

=== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ===
:''"Vizima is also home to half-elves, born of unions between humans and elves. Female half-elves are possessed of a delicate, inimitable beauty. Many are fluent in the Elder Language."''

=== [[Romance card]] ===
After Geralt saves her he can speak with her to get her card. She can be found in a house almost exactly opposite [[Vivaldi's place]], across a small barrier (you can enter this part of the green light district from the St. Lebioda's hospital side).
