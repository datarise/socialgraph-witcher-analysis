'''Hammond''' was a [[Slavery|slaver]] and former member of [[Jad Karadin]]'s gang, along with [[Selyse]], [[Lund]] and [[Vienne]]. He was considered to be Karadin's right-hand man.
==Biography==
As a member of Jad Karadin's gang he was one of the people responsible for the death of the witcher [[Aiden]] of the [[Cat School]]. After the gang disbanded, Hammond travelled to [[Skellige]] and started a slave trade business in [[Trottheim]]. He built his reputation as the chief pirate of [[Faroe]], commanding a mighty fleet, gaining bounties in every island of Skellige and the respect of the jarls. He was in constant conflict with [[Holger Blackhand]].

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt goes after him}} In {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, he was meditating at an altar near the slave market when [[Geralt of Rivia]] approached him, chasing information about Jad Karadin. Unwilling to betray Karadin's trust, Hammond attacked the [[witcher]] and met his end. Geralt later tells Lambert that Hammond was in business with Karadin, the two having remained in contact despite appearances.
