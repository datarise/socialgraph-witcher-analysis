Being a soldier, he knew the general situation of what was going on during the [[Third Northern War]]. At one point, he ended up camping out with two others: a merchant named [[Manfred (merchant)|Manfred]] and a sorcerer named [[Theophile Maria Rosco]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by to talk and refuses to get involved or helps Rufus}} Rufus killed Manfred, believing he was a spy, though he had no proof. On searching Manfred's body, he felt the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] [[Floren|florens]] the merchant had been carrying were enough to justify his suspicions.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by to talk but then defends Manfred}} Sadly, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] had no other choice but to kill Rufus, who was dead set on killing Manfred, believing he was a spy.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by but leaves after introduction}} Rufus remained passive, and the original three men continued to camp out.
