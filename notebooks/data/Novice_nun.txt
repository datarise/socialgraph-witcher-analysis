[[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] first meets the '''Novice nun''' (or ''Novice nurse'') at [[St. Lebioda's Hospital]]. She tells him about the goddess [[Melitele]] and about sacrifices of fruits, plants or flowers on Melitele's [[Altar of Melitele|altars]]. Sacrifices of [[flowers]] like tulips, orchids, roses, etc... are not acceptable. Only sacrifices of [[The Witcher food and drink|fruit]] like grapes, blueberries, raspberries, or [[The Witcher food and drink|dried fruit]] are worthy.

Later in Chapter II, if Geralt speaks with her again, he can ask a sort of cryptic question to which he gets an equally cryptic reply but it does not seem to impact gameplay in any way. Finally, in Chapter V, he finds her in the [[Safe house]], along with [[Vaska]], [[Golan Vivaldi]], the [[hermit]], the [[resolute girl]] and [[Vetala]]. They speak about whether or not [[Ithlinne's Prophecy|Ithlinne's prophecy]] is coming true and she also gives him an update on [[Carmen]] and [[Vincent]].

== Notes ==
* Even though the offerings at the Melitele [[Altar of Melitele|altar]] at the hospital are supposed to be "vegetarian" in nature, to receive [[Mistletoe]] in exchange, you can actually offer meat as well.
