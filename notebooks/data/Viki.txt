== Biography ==
Around {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, a coup was instigated in her kingdom and the royal family was overthrown. She was then named protector of the [[Valgridovt|crown prince]] and the two boarded one of two ships set for [[Beauclair]], where they were likely seeking asylum.

However, the [[Dirgelech|usurper]] back home sent warriors after them and one of the ships wrecked on an island in [[Skellige]], though luckily Viki and the young prince were on the other ship. The two made it as far as [[Ursten]] in [[Velen]] before their ship also crashed, stranding them in a foreign land and, to make matters worse, Viki couldn't speak any of the [[Common Speech|local language]]. They then took refuge in [[Widows' Grotto]] as Viki tried to figure out what to do next.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt finds them and protects them}} while she couldn't understand the [[witcher]], or he understand her, she was grateful nonetheless and, now that the last warrior that'd been following them was dead, she and the boy set out once more.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt finds them but stands aside}} Viki met her end far from home as the warrior cut her down without a second thought.
