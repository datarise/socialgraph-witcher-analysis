'''Manfred''' was a [[Kaedwen]]i soldier and [[Sven (Manfred's son)|Sven]]'s father.

== Journal Entry ==
:''A father's care for his son, even an adult son, can cause even the bravest to grieve and worry. Manfred was an old soldier, a Kaedweni veteran of many battles who had lived a full life. Yet the thought of outliving his son, who was to face the terrifying [[Letande Avet|Butcher of Cidaris]] in the arena, had broken the brave man. Manfred tried to drown his sadness and despair in booze in the camp canteen.''
:'''If Sven survives in the arena during the quest The Butcher of Cidaris:'''
::''After his son emerged from the arena victorious, Manfred rewarded [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]]. He was extremely helpful to the [[witcher]], proving himself a man of honor.''
:'''If Sven dies in the arena during the quest The Butcher of Cidaris or the quest fails:'''
::''His son's death was a terrible blow to Manfred. Though the witcher had failed to save Sven, the old warrior behaved honorably and helped him as best he could.''
