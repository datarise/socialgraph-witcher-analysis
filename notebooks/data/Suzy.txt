If approached, she initially tried to be somewhat seductive, stating she was under a spell and asking if [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] came there to kiss her to break it, but when asked to reveal anything about herself she refuses.

==Notes==
* Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either [[Triss Merigold|Triss]] or [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] and will not affect any of the romance endings Geralt can receive.
