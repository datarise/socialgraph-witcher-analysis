== Journal Entry ==
: ''Supposedly involved in commercial dealings with Bernard Loredo, this man was a frequent guest at the commandant's abode.''
: ''In point of fact, Arnolt was an agent serving the kingdom of Kaedwen, which sought to annex the trading post so as to take control of the trade route upon which it lay.''
: ''Unfortunately, mortality rates are terrifyingly high among spies who are captured and then prove uncooperative. Arnolt failed to survive his interrogation, and so this "living proof of Kaedweni scheming" was history.''
