Harmond was caught in the blast and subsequently shattered when the ship began to break apart.

== ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Artbook|The Witcher 2 Digital Artbook]]'' description ==
:''The two jesters display truly clownish humor. Their coarse, at times even vulgar situational comedy was meant as a foil to the monarch's majestic presence. Though this is achieved, they simultaneously underline the king's evidently plebeian tastes. The ruler finds their bumbling funny – as most probably many people in the Middle Ages would.''
