'''Yanina''' was an elderly woman in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} who lived near [[Honeyfill Meadworks]] in a small, isolated hut.

== Biography ==
One day, her chickens started disappearing; in particular, only one would go missing each day. Her deceased husband, who'd been a poacher, had taught her how to read tracks and so she immediately believed it was a [[Wolf (creature)|wolf]], though it was rather odd that it was walking on its hind legs. However, when she spoke of this to others, they dismissed her claims.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt investigates}} [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] tracked down the "monster" only to discover it was actually 3 clever, young orphans who were stealing to survive.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt convinces Yanina to take them in}} on discovering they were children, Yanina took them in, where they kept her company and helped with the chores.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't convince Yanina to take them in}} true to their word, the children stole all the rest of Yanina's chickens, much to the elderly woman's dismay.
