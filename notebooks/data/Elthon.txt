*[[A Sackful of Fluff]]

== Journal Entry ==
:''This inhabitant of a hut near the quarry had one of the oddest jobs I have ever heard of. Namely, Elthon served as a purchasing agent for a collector of [[harpy feathers]], offering the witcher generous sums for pinions and retrices picked from the carcasses of [[Harpy|harpies]].''
:''As it turned out, Elthon was not buying feathers for a collector but for himself. With the sackful of plumage Geralt supplied, he finally fulfilled his dream of transforming himself from an ugly duckling into a swan, or more precisely a queen harpy.''
