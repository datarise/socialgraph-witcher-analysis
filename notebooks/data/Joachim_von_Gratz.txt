== Journal Entry ==
: ''We met Joachim von Gratz, chief surgeon at Vilmerius Hospital, in very unfortunate circumstances. My [[Priscilla]] had been attacked and he was tending to her wounds.''
: ''I must admit I was so shaken I hardly remember our first meeting, save that he was a cool-headed doctor who seemed to know a great deal about the previous murders and offered his help investigating the matter.''
: ''It seemed the surgeon was no stranger to violence, for he bore a formidable scar worthy of a veteran of the [[Battle of Brenna]].''
: ''Geralt also noted that Von Gratz seemed quite experienced at navigating the [[Novigrad sewers|sewers]] and fighting the monsters dwelling within it.''
: ''It was hard not to notice that Joachim von Gratz did not care much for the city coroner, [[Hubert Rejk]], who dropped in unexpectedly on Geralt and the doctor at the morgue.''
: '''If Geralt didn't catch the real murderer:'''
:: ''In the end von Gratz was eliminated as a suspect, but like Geralt he had to admit defeat in his attempts to outwit the psychopathic murderer.''
