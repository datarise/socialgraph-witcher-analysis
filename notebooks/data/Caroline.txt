She died in the fangs of [[barghest]]s one night on her way to the [[Outskirts Inn|Inn]] with the boy in the opening sequence of [[:Category:The Witcher Chapter I|Chapter I]]. We know she was not his biological mother because of a conversation Alvin has with [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] at the Inn the following day. During that conversation, Alvin mentions that his parents were already dead and that he has no other kin whatsoever.
