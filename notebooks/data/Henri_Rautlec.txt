'''Henri Rautlec''', called familiarly '''Hank''', was a famed [[halfling]] portrait artist and a friend of such names as [[Dandelion]] or [[Count de Luverten]].

== Biography ==
In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, Rautlec was hired by Dandelion to paint new placards for the [[Rosemary and Thyme|Chameleon]] but he got in debt and thus required help to get out of it. After a group of angry creditors seized his home in order to either take him or anything valuable, he ran to the races near [[Vegelbud Residence]] where his friend the Count made him an offer: he was to wager on one more race and if he won, the Count would pay all his debts.

== Trivia ==
* This character draws many comparisons with and references the French 19th-century painter and illustrator [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]. He produced posters for the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret upon its inaugural opening and had a rather short stature at 1.42 metres (4 ft 8 in) due to stunted leg growth.
