This '''armorer''' is in a building right off of [[Oxenfurt]]'s market and is a [[Gwent]] player who uses the [[Scoia'tael Gwent deck|Scoia'tael deck]].

He talked a bit to [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] initially, excited to see a [[witcher]] visit his shop as he'd have him craft far more interesting things than what the locals typically need.
