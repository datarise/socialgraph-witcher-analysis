This '''Quartermaster''' was stationed at the [[Nilfgaardian Garrison]] in [[White Orchard]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, and was an amateur [[blacksmith]].

== Biography ==
When [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] first talked to him, he accused him of spying, showing that he did not trust [[Nordlings]]. He did so again if Geralt asked about camp morale, and added that the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] victory was assured and nothing more. However, this may only have been a warning since he was keen to trade and do blacksmith work.

He's located downstairs from the main building of the garrison, where [[Peter Saar Gwynleve]], the captain of the garrison, had his working space and desk.

When you meet him for the first time, he'll have 680 {{Crown}}.

== Notes ==
* He will only sell [[runestone]]s after the prologue is finished and Geralt returns to the area.
