'''Myron''' was a master [[medic|apothecary]] and [[The Witcher 2 merchants|merchant]] in the employ of the [[Kaedwenian Army]] who could be found in the hospital tent west of the [[Kaedweni camp]] canteen. In free time, he was a [[The Witcher 2 dice poker|dice poker player]].

He liked to jest, as evidenced in [[Geralt of Rivia]]'s first meeting with him. Master Myron was also interested in the [[Wild Hunt]]. After finding the [[Wild Hunt investigator's notes]] in the catacombs and asking [[Sheala de Tancarville]] about it, Geralt might have discussed it with him and summarize his findings.

His wares included the formula for [[Gadwall]] potion.

== Journal Entry ==
:''Stiff as a halberd, the apothecary Myron ran the field hospital and sold alchemical ingredients on the side.''

== Trivia ==
* He might be a reference to Myron, a character in Fallout 2 who also dabble in chemistry.
