'''Hierophants''' are the male leaders of [[druid circles]]. The female equivalents are called "[[Flaminika|flaminikas]]". The leader of the circle at [[Caed Myrkvid]] was a flaminique. It was her idea to take the old wives' tales of druids burning trespassers alive in [[wicker hag]]s and make it a reality.
