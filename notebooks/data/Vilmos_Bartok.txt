'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the incense merchant in [[Flotsam]]. [[Vencel Pugg]] is extremely interested in the recipe for one particular blend of incense.

Some Flotsam women are very suspicious about the true nature of the substances that Vilmos sells. Indeed it is quite odd that the incense causes hallucinations and is addictive.

Vilmos Bartok also sells some [[The Witcher 2 ingredients|alchemical ingredients]] (herbs and plants), [[The Witcher 2 crafting components|crafting components]] and some [[:Category:The Witcher 2 crafting diagrams|recipes]] for [[The Witcher 2 potions|potions]] and [[The Witcher 2 oils|oils]].
