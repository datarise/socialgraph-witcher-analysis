The '''Gravedigger''', unknown by name, worked as a [[Gravedigger|digger of graves]]. He can be found during the day at his post outside the [[Vizima cemetery]] gate, in the [[Temple Quarter]]. He is certainly never adverse to a bottle of the [[Alcoholic beverages|good stuff]]. He apparently has a penchant for [[Dwarf|dwarven]] tinctures. He is the guy to talk to about anything to do with the cemetery or dead bodies.
