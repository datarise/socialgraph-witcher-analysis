'''Olcan''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He seems to serve the deities [[Kreve]], [[Freya]] and [[Melitele]].

He is killed by King [[Henselt]] during the preamble to Chapter II when a fight between the Kaedwenis and Aedirnians breaks out. He tries to stop the bloodshed but Henselt, blinded by rage, viciously slams him into a large stone obelisk, killing him. His death unleashes a series of strange happenings, including an eclipse. Later we learn that it has unleashed the full power of Sabrina's curse.

Also he is the one responsible for [[Saskia]]'s poisoning.

== Associated Quests ==
* [[Prelude to War: Aedirn]]
* [[Prelude to War: Kaedwen]]
* [[The Walls Have Ears]]
* [[The Eternal Battle]] (his death unleashes these events)

== Journal Entry ==
:''Olcan, the priest from Prince Stennis' retinue, turned out to be directly responsible for the poisoning of [[Saskia]]. The clergyman apparently thought that a heavy dose of thaumador would be more effective than prayer or excommunication. Unfortunately, because he was already dead, he could not answer for his deed.''
