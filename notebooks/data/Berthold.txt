==Biography==
In {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, during the [[witch hunts]] in Novigrad, Berthold and wife [[Anisse]] went into hiding in their house. Approached by [[Triss Merigold]], they were invited on a ship to [[Kovir]] to safety. With a plan to meet at [[The Kingfisher Inn]], they became trapped as [[witch hunter]]s surrounded their house.

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt saves them}} making the decision to leave none behind, Triss and [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] went to Anisse and Berthold's hideout and killed the witch hunters there. Berthold and his wife went with the two to The Kingfisher Inn, and escaped to the [[Novigrad Docks|docks]] through the [[Novigrad sewers]] with the other mages. They boarded the ship and departed for a new and safer life in Kovir.
