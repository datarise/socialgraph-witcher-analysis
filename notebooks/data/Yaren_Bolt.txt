}}'''Yaren Bolt''' was a [[dwarf]] and the leader of the band of woodcutters who logged the ancient yews in the [[Lumberjacks' glade]] in the [[Swamp]]. Apparently, these magnificent specimens make excellent wainscoting. He rules his crew with an iron fist, but it is for their own good. Without him, many of them might not make it back home.

He has no time for the notions of the brickmakers and views them more as trainable simpletons for his enterprise. His opinion of the vodyanoi is equally glowing.
