'''Munro Bruys''' was an adventurer from [[Mahakam]] in the [[Zoltan Chivay's company|company]] of [[Zoltan Chivay]] during the 1260s. After the [[Battle of Brenna]], in which he avenged one of his mates [[Caleb Stratton]], Bruys planned to do business in [[Novigrad]]. Eventually, he ended up a bouncer in [[Vizima]].

==Biography==
===Life in a company===
A [[dwarf]] born in Mahakam, Bruys joined Chivay's band.<ref name="bof">{{BoF}}</ref> For several days, [[bard]] [[Jezkier]] traveled and sung by their side. During one such day, their camp had been approached by [[Brendan]]. Bruys grew warry but Chivay calmed him, introducing Brendan as an old friend.<ref>{{WGW}}</ref>

Once, the group waylaid and robbed a rich [[hawker]] who tried to flee [[Dillingen]] after townfolk exposed his trade with [[Scoia'tael]]. The [[merchant]] defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid a few times until the dwarves got him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, Bruys helped load the trunks on a wagon.

In late summer {{Year|canon=yes|year=1267}}, Bruys and the rest had been escorting [[Kernow]] refugees, mothers and children, to safety. They met [[Geralt of Rivia]] and the [[Geralt's company|witcher's own group]] for the first time on a way toward the [[Yaruga]] river from [[Brokilon]]. Chivay advised Geralt to join up with dwarves on a way eastward. When the large group became short on provisions, Bruys and [[Yazon Varda]] vanished into the dark, only to return at dawn with two full sacks, one with [[horse]] grub and the second with jerkies, cheese, huge haggis and more refreshment. Another time, he and [[Figgis Merluzzo]] went mushroom picking. Later on, [[Percival Schuttenbach]] sensed porridge with his infallible [[Gnome|gnomish]] nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Bruys and Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call. Bruys anxiously asked Chivay when he learned bird sounds. Chivay answered the point was if Bruys heard an unrecognizable sound, he would know it's them.

After crossing [[Brugge]], the group stopped at [[O]]. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Bruys, Varda, Merluzzo and [[Caleb Stratton]] to hide it. The rest continued to [[Fen Carn]]. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugees-killing [[Nilfgaardian Army]] and the [[Temerian Army]], Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the [[7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade]]. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in [[Angren]], and Bruys gave each member a strong handshake. At long last, the company decided to return home to [[Mount Carbon]].<ref name="bof" />

===Fighting Nilfgaard===
[[File:Gwent_cardart_scoiatael_munro_bruys.jpeg|thumb|156px|Bruys fighting at Brenna.|left]]
As the end of the [[Northern War II|Second Northern War]] had drawn near, Bruys and Merluzzo were part of officer Zoltan Chivay's unit of the [[Mahakam Volunteer Army]]. In spring {{Year|canon=yes|year=1268}}, most regiments sent by [[Elder of Mahakam]] [[Brouver Hoog]] suffered great losses and were withdrawn to [[Vizima]]. With time to recover, most dwarves enjoyed [[beer]] and fist-fighting at [[The Shaggy Bear]] tavern.

To stop the advancing enemy, [[Temeria]] mustered its forces and prepared for the [[Battle of Brenna]]. Thousands of dogged dwarven volunteers commanded by [[Colonel]] [[Barclay Els]] stood the right-wing. Alongside the eight light cavalry companies and infamous [[Adieu's Free Company]], unwavering in the face of [[Ard Feainn Division]] riders.

When Field Marshal [[Menno Coehoorn]] tried to run from the battlefield, half-buried in mud pleading for mercy, Chivay showed him to Bruys. Mistaking the Field Marshal for a Daerlanian cavalryman due to a silver scorpion sigil, Bruys swung his weapon up. Thus, they avenged Stratton by unknowingly killing the Nilfgaardian commanding officer.

===Novigrad and Vizima===
Bruys always dreamed of building steam and water-powered hammerworks. Following the [[Peace of Cintra]], he agreed to start one in [[Novigrad]] with Merluzzo and Chivay.<ref>{{TLotL}}</ref> However, the mutual venture flopped.<ref>{{Gwent standalone}}</ref> Bruys returned to Vizima, moving there for good as he landed a bouncer position at The Shaggy Bear. A self-titled [[The Witcher dice poker|professional dice player]], Bruys earned bonus [[oren]]s gambling.

In {{Year|canon=no|year=1270}}, Bruys kept in touch with Zoltan Chivay who told him witcher Geralt, thought dead since [[Rivian Pogrom|pogrom]] in [[Rivia]], lived. Initially refusing to believe, the dwarf welcomed Geralt with open arms when the witcher entered the tavern in [[Temple Quarter]]. When asked, Bruys praised his job as peaceful and reminded Geralt of past adventures.<ref name="tw1">{{Tw1}}</ref>
