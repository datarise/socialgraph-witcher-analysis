'''Zdenek''' was an aging [[Fistfighters in The Witcher|champion]] of [[The Witcher fistfighting|fistfighting]], considered the world's best boxer throughout [[Temeria]] due to never being defeated twice in a row. However, when he went to enter [[Whoreson Junior]]'s [[Whoreson Junior's arena|arena]] in [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he was murdered by thugs just outside the arena.

== Biography ==
Little is known about his past. "Zdenek" was his pseudonym but he kept his real name a secret. During {{Year|canon=no|year=1270}}, Zdenek could be found in the [[Refugees' caves|southernmost refugee cave]] in the [[swamp cemetery]], keeping his fistfights to the privacy of his own chamber in the cave. One of his biggest fans was [[Zahin Schmartz]], who would pay 250{{Oren}} for Zdenek's tooth.

After leaving Vizima he went to [[Flotsam]] where he became champion soon enough. He also slightly changed his appearance by shaving his head.

In 1272 he ended up in Novigrad where he was murdered by thugs near [[The Nowhere Inn]] on his way to join fistfights in Whoreson Junior's arena.
