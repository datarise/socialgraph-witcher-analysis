'''Lena''' was a young woman living in [[White Orchard]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}} with her parents, who didn't hide the fact that they'd harm their own daughter if she was ever caught with one of the "enemies", that is, a [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]]. Therefore, she kept her relationship with a Nilfgaardian soldier a secret.

== Biography ==
{{Condition|Text = If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] visits [[Tomira]] and asks about Lena}} Tomira informed the [[witcher]] Lena had been attacked by the local [[Griffin (creature)|griffin]] while trying to sneak out at night into the woods, undoubtedly to rendezvous with a lover. However, her wounds were too extensive and it was only a matter of time before she died.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt leaves her be}} Lena soon died from her wounds.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt attempts to heal her}} Despite the risks of a witcher potion, Geralt gave Tomira [[Swallow]] in the hopes it could heal Lena, though it could possibly make things worse. Soon after administering it, Nilfgaardian soldiers appeared and took Lena with them. However, while Lena's injuries healed enough that she didn't die, the potion had addled her mind to the point she didn't know what was going on around her, effectively leaving her insane. She was eventually relocated to the [[Nilfgaardian Army Group 'Center' Camp]], where her boyfriend was stationed.

::{{Condition|Text = If Geralt visits the army center camp}} On spotting Geralt, Lena's boyfriend stopped the witcher and mentioned Lena, revealing that he was the one she was supposed to meet on that ill-fated night. After revealing that Lena was physically alive, he remarked that he was torn between wanting to curse the witcher for not allowing her to die with dignity and thanking him for saving her life.
