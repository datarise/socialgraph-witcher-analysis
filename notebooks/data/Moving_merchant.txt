* In between [[Carsten]] and [[Vegelbud Residence]]
* At the crossroads, east of [[Glory Gate]] and northwest of [[Cunny of the Goose]]
Also, at each location he offers a different conversation option. He sells some [[The Witcher 3 crafting components|components to crafting]], but most of his wares are animal hides. He does not play [[gwent]].
