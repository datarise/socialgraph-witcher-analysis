'''Malena''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}.

Like many non-humans in [[Flotsam]], she works as a servant for humans. Geralt meets her when she is being harassed by Loredo's men, accusing her of being a [[Scoia'tael]] and responsible for the murder of their companions. If Geralt decides to interfere in the conversation and listen to Malena, she brings them to the entrance of a cave west of the pier, asking the witcher to find the corpses and some evidence on them. After exploring the cave it is revealed that [[Scoia'tael]] did indeed murder the soldiers. Malena's fate is in Geralt's hands and it is up to the player to decide what to do.
