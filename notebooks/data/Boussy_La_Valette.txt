'''Boussy La Valette''' was the son of [[Mary Louisa La Valette]] and brother of [[Anaïs La Valette|Anaïs]]. Who his father was is not known for sure. Officially, it was the [[Old Baron La Valette]], but many rumors persist that he and his sister were actually [[King]] [[Foltest]] of [[Temeria]]'s progeny. If this is true, then both he and his sister were in line for the Temerian throne.

In Chapter II, if [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] chose [[Vernon Roche|Roche]]'s path, he learned that Boussy was accidentally killed in the attempt to kidnap the siblings, leaving his sister, Anaïs, the sole heir to the throne.

== Journal Entry ==
: ''No more than a lad back then, Boussy already displayed the pride and obstinacy typical of the La Valettes. Some, however, attributed these qualities to the fact that King Foltest was his father.''
: ''The boy had died in mysterious circumstances, but the significance of this event was clear. Of [[Baroness]] La Valette's and King Foltest's two children, only Anaïs remained alive – a young girl born out of wedlock, the sole and highly problematic heir to the Temerian throne.''
: ''As Geralt was sailing up the Pontar, Boussy was packed up and placed in a convoy that was to take him to Loc Muinne. The boy never reached the city. The rumors Geralt had heard from King Radovid proved true. Vile intentions had bred a series of unfortunate coincidences. In short, Boussy was dead.''
