}}'''Fugas''' was one of many servants of the [[Crones|Ladies of the Woods]], who lived in [[Bald Mountain (location)|Bald Mountain]].

== Journal Entry ==
: ''The [[Sylvan|devil]] Fugas held a very prestigious and responsible position during the Crones' sabbath: that of goon restricting access to the peak. He in no way resembled [[Torque]], the irritating but harmless "deovel" [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Dandelion|I]] had encountered many, many years prior.''
: ''Fugas' size resembled that of a somewhat overgrown [[troll]], and he likewise displayed a troll's lack of subtlety. There was not a jot of mischievous puck or cunning verbal trickster about this "devil." Instead, he carried out his task with the commitment and professionalism of a [[Novigrad]] bouncer.''
: ''Trying to stop Geralt, though, turned out to be Fugas' dumbest and final idea, ending both his life and his flourishing career in the Crones' employ.''
