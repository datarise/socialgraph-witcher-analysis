This unidentified [[Skellige]] woman was a long-time mistress of [[King]] [[Bran Tuirseach]]. During Bran's funeral she, and not his wife, [[Birna Bran]], threw herself on his corpse before the drakkar was launched into the sea. She laid on top of him, crying as [[Crach an Craite]] loosened a flaming arrow onto the pile, burning both.
