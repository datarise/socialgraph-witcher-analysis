Throughout Velen there are several constantly traveling traders.

== Trader (eastern side) ==
This '''trader''' sells mostly [[The Witcher 3 alchemy ingredients|alchemy ingredients]] and can be found wandering the roads around [[Velen]] in the following areas:
* along the road starting at the crossroads area south of [[Drahim Castle]] and east along the roads then north to the hut southeast of [[Cunny of the Goose]]
* from the eastern gate of [[Stonecutters' Settlement]] and up the road to a point on the road almost exactly east of [[Codgers' Quarry]] signpost

== Trader (Lucian's Windmill) ==
This trader also sells mostly alchemy ingredients and can be found wandering on the western side of [[Grassy Knoll]], from a small campfire just west of [[Lucian's Windmill]] and follows the road northeast to [[Farcorners]], then north to [[Portside Gate]] and east about halfway to [[Glory Gate]] before turning back around.

== Notes ==
* Unlike many of the other merchants, the traders' model varies throughout a single game, likely to make them appear as several different merchants rather than just one.
