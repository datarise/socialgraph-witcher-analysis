}}'''Edna var Attre''' was one of the daughters of the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] [[ambassador]] [[Henry var Attre]]. Her older twin sister, [[Rosa var Attre|Rosa]], and herself moved constantly as, wherever their father's job took them, they were also brought along. In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, when their father was stationed in [[Novigrad]], the twins were moved to the free city as well.

However, despite being twins, they only appeared to share physical traits. Where Rosa liked sword fighting, Edna loved to cause mischief, in particular putting her twin sister in uncomfortable situations, like writing love letters in Rosa's name to make [[Dandelion]] think she was interested in him.
