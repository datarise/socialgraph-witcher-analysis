This '''barber''' lived in a shop in the eastern part of [[The Bits]], the poorest district of [[Novigrad]]. He only charged 5 {{Crown}} for cutting [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]]'s beard or hair, but is permanently drunk, so you better look for another barber.
== Notes ==
* He has a small chance of giving a different haircut from the one you asked. The first time this happens, Geralt will openly protest against his behavior, with the barber responding in lack of care for his opinion.
