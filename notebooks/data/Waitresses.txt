Among the many pleasant sights in and around [[Vizima]] are the '''waitresses''' who can be found in the many local [[inns and taverns]] scattered about town. These obliging gals can often be called upon to provide valuable information about the area and/or its residents. They also buy and sell a variety of items:
* [[The Witcher food and drink|food]]
* [[drink]]
* [[blade coating bases|grease]]

Some can even arrange for [[The Witcher character interaction|accommodation]].
