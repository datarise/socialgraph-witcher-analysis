The existence of the resident witch in [[Murky Waters]] can depend on one of the very first difficult choices Geralt faces in the course of the game.

This is the "old woman" healer. She provides for the magical and healing needs of the village of Murky Waters. She also buys and sells a number of things, including: [[The Witcher ingredients|ingredients]] and [[:Category:Alcohol|alcohol]]. She also pays for valuable ([[:Category:Additional goods|non-alchemical]]) monster parts and dispenses information valuable to the plot. She will buy:

* [[Wolf pelt]]s
* [[Basilisk hide]]s
* [[Graveir Bone|Graveir bones]]
* [[Fleder fang]]s
== Associated Quests ==
* [[Of Monsters and Men]]
* [[The Devourer Contract]]
* [[The Heat of the Day]]
* [[Small Problems]]

== Notes ==
Much earlier in the game, in the [[Outskirts]], Geralt meets [[Abigail]], the local witch. Her relationship with the residents of the Outskirts is rocky, to say the least. Geralt must decide whether to help her or leave her to the villagers at the end of the chapter. His choice determines whether or not you meet the healer described above, or run into Abigail for a second time.[[cs:Místní léčitelka]]
