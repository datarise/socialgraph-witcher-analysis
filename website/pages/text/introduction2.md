# Introduction

The Witcher is a world wide phenomena. It started out with a book series, then became one of the most popular games and the second season of the Netflix series will soon be released. The Witcher universe is huge and has many different characters within it. This website aims to explore and analyse the characters within the universe with network analysis. Hopefully this will lead to some interesting facts and insights about the universe. 

## Method
The methods used in this analysis is taught in the course 02805 Social graphs and interactions at DTU. The analysis contains network analysis and text analysis. The analysis is made with Python and the main packages used are  [Networkx](https://networkx.org/) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/). 

## Data 
The data for this analysis is collected from [The Witcher Fandom Wiki](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki). The character page for all characters is downloaded and saves as a text file. From all these character pages a graph can be created and the character attributes can be added to all the nodes. 

## How to use this website

This website is made with Streamlit and is therefore very interactive. This means that you the user can try to analyse the Witcher network yourself. There will be many different options to explore with can be overwhelming. Therefore the default output of everything out see will be the output of our analysis and how we intent to show it. Sometimes we will instruct you to play around with the interface to see different outcomes.
