In this section you will explore the Witcher network. There are two ways to visualize it. The first one is to visualize the whole network and can be done to the right. There are multiple different options to visualize the network by. First you can select witch attribute you want to color the network by. Next you can select the layout algorithm to explore the network by. The Barnes Hut or Force Atlas seems to give the best results. The last thing to select is if the network visualization should have smooth edges. The network looks best when this is selected. To view the network select *display the network*. This is due to that the network takes some time to load. Please be patient! 

When the graph is loaded you will note the following: 

1. Geralt of Rivia is the biggest node. This makes good sense as he is the character that you play in the game 
2. There are some node that are not characters such as Gwent Players and Merchants These represent a link too all these characters that you can interact with in the game. 
3. Many of the nodes has some missing features. This is due to that not all characters has all attributes.
