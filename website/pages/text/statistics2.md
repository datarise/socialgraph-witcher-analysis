Above you can see the in and out degree distribution of the network. The in-degree is the number of edges that goes into a node. For the games this means that the if a character has contact with another character they will have a count. The out-degree is the number of edges out from a node. You will note that the average degree is 3.7. This means that on average a character is connected to 3.7 other characters. If you look at the distribution plots above and the table to the side you will note that the degree distribution has really long tails. This means that there are a few characters that are very connected.
