The this section you can explore the sentiment of the characters of the Witcher universe. The sentiment scores are computed using the VADER sentiment scoring system, so you will see scores between -1 and 1 where 1 is as happy as can be and inversely -1 is very sad or unhappy. To the right is the overall distribution of sentiment across all the characters, and quickly it becomes clear that the story of the Witcher is not a happy one. 

Below you can pick an attribute to see sentiment scores on, with the default being name. The sentiment of all characters in alphabetical order is shown there so look for your favourite character and see if they are generally happy or sad. Try sorting by Nationality to see the sentiment of the different countries on the continent. You will discover the effects of the fall of Cintra or the barbaric sadness of the warring Nilfgardian empire. You can also see that a neutral simple life from the region of Kovir generally brings happiness as they have abstained from taking part in the many wars that has devastated the continent. Perhaps sort by Profession to figure out what you would want to do. A court jester or an actor seem to be a lot happier than a commander or a servant.
