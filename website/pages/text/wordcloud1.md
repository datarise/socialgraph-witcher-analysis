In this section you can explore the most important words belonging to the attribute groups of the characters. Select the attribute you want to check out, such as Race and pick a couple races that you find interesting. Check out human and elf for example. You will see that the words "family", "emperor" and "clan" are important, emphasizing the human need for community and leadership. The elves are a millitary driven people and thus "commando" is a word that is important to them. Also elven words such as "aen", "elle" and "seidhe" show up, where Aen Elle and Aen Seidhe denote the two main groupings of elves. Aen Seidhe inhabit the continent alongside humans and Aen Elle moved to another world decades ago. Perhaps choose Gender and see that females are defined by "blinding" "beauty" and "sexuality" hinting to the medieval worldview that the Witcher universe perpetuates. The males are defined by words such as "betrayed" "crew" and "workshop" which hints that backstabbing, but also largely work is central to a man. Again the medieval worldview where a man is defined by his work shines through.
