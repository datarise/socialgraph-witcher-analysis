In this section the Witcher graph can be compared to multiple random networks. You can select a number of nodes for your random graph. To match the Witcher graph choose around 800, but have patience as the graphs become heavier to produce. It should be clear that the Barabasi-Albert graph matches the Witcher graph with regards to distribution where the Erdos-Reyni is very different. This is due to the Barabasi-Albert graph utilizing preferential attachment. This can be seen in all the plots below the actual graph plot.
