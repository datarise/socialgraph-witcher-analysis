'''Theophile Maria Rosco''' was a [[mage]] passing through between [[Novigrad]] and [[Oxenfurt]] when he set up camp with two others: a [[Redania]]n soldier named [[Rufus]] and a merchant named [[Manfred (merchant)|Manfred]].

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Strangers in the Night (The Witcher 3)|Strangers in the Night]]

== Notes ==
* Regardless how [[Strangers in the Night (The Witcher 3)|Strangers in the Night]] is done, he remains neutral, staying out of the argument.
* Oddly, ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt: Official Prima Guide'' lists his middle name as "Mario" instead of "Maria". It is unclear what caused this discrepancy.
* Considering [[Radovid V]]'s stance on killing every mage, it's unclear why Rufus doesn't bother Theophile. It's suggested that maybe Theophile is supporting Radovid's plan somehow or just a developer oversight.
