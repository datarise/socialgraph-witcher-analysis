'''Rupert Brandhuber''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He was a [[Medic|Field Medic]] within [[Aedirnian Army|Aedirnian Military]] during the [[Second Northern War]].

== [[The Witcher 2 journal|Journal]] Entry ==
:''Geralt first encountered Rupert near the ruins of the [[Burned down hospital|asylum]] in the [[Flotsam forests|forest]] beyond [[Flotsam]]. The Aedirnian medic claimed he had come to the area with his friend [[Gridley]] in search of rare herbs. However, it appeared they had underestimated the dangers lurking in both the forest and the ruins.''
:''Something was missing from his story, however. Rupert had been a medic in a field hospital during the war. He and his friends had committed a crime back then. Years later the wraith of the [[Nilfgaardian's wraith|Nilfgaardian soldier]] they had tortured to death summoned them to the scene of the crime so to have its revenge.''
:'''If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] decides to give him and [[Gridley]] to the wraith:'''
::''Crime begets punishment, and this case was no different. Geralt had no desire to defend murderers, and Rupert and his friend got what they deserved.''
:'''If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] decides to give him and [[Gridley]] to [[Bernard Loredo|Loredo]]:'''
::''Even though Rupert was a reprehensible criminal, Geralt did not give him to the wraith. Yet he decided the villains must pay for their deeds. Thanks to the unexpected intervention of a certain woman, they were arrested, possibly for other crimes.''
:'''If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] tells him and [[Gridley]] to go away:'''
::''Even though Rupert was a complete criminal, Geralt did not give him to the wraith. He was content to drive both villains away.''
:'''If the quest fails:'''
::''Because later events hit him like an avalanche, Geralt did not have an occasion to learn how [[Gridley]]'s and Rupert's story ended. We could make conjunctures {{sic}}, but I leave that to the imagination of my readers.''
