'''Thecla''' was a very old, blind woman that was considered to be wise by the locals around the [[Road to Bald Mountain|village]] below [[Bald Mountain (location)|Bald Mountain]] and who worshiped the [[Crones]]. A cunning senior, she was accompanied by her young helper or more precisely servant, [[Marica]].

At one point, she claimed that those in [[Downwarren]] were being punished with [[The Whispering Hillock]] for disrespecting the Crones.
