==Biography==
A powerful mage, var Ypsis was able to tame a djinn and use it as a source of power. He published his findings in a tome that ended up in the Imperial Library, where it was eventually discovered by [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]].

Var Ypsis's last expedition was to [[Skellige]]. He traveled to the village of [[Larvik]] on [[Hindarsfjall]], where he had contact with the locals. With his djinn in tow, he departed Larvik by ship and sailed to [[Ingdalen Isle]] before an unusually powerful storm broke out. In order to get out of the storm, var Ypsis made a wish to his djinn, which teleported its master, along with part of the ship and a section of the seabed, to a mountaintop in northern [[Ard Skellig]]. Due to a very rough landing at the destination, var Ypsis was knocked out of his boots, before being crushed to death by a falling bookcase inside his cabin.
