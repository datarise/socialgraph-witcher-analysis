== Biography ==
The priest of the Eternal Fire had been a customer of Titus', buying fisstech off him three times without a hassle. That changed one day though, where the priest decided to silence Titus completely and had his thugs attack him, then left him for dead, hoping the [[necrophage]]s in the area would kill him.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt saves Titus then questions him}} The priest hired [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to burn the bodies in the area, claiming that it'd prevent the spread of disease and necrophages. However, Geralt found Titus fighting a pack of [[ghoul]]s and jumped in to help him out. Afterwards, Titus revealed what had transpired beforehand before deciding he had enough of the area and was going to leave.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt saves him but doesn't question him}} Having enough with the area and nearly being killed for it, Titus proclaimed he was leaving, even if it meant traveling all the way to [[Poviss]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't save him}} Unfortunately for Titus, he was killed by the ghouls in the area and thus all evidence of the priest's crimes disappeared.
