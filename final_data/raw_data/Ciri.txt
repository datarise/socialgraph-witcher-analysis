'''Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon''' (better known as '''Ciri'''), was born in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1252}} or {{Year|canon=yes|year=1253}},<ref>The novels are not clear when it comes to dates/Ciri's age. See the notes section for inconsistencies.</ref> and most likely during the [[Belleteyn]] holiday.<ref>{{TLW}}</ref> She was the sole [[princess]] of [[Cintra]], the daughter of [[Pavetta]] and [[Emhyr var Emreis]] (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as [[Queen]] [[Calanthe]]'s granddaughter.

After [[Geralt of Rivia]] helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the [[witcher]] would like and Geralt evoked the [[Law of Surprise]], as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.

== Biography ==
Ciri was born in [[Skellige]] in [[Belleteyn]] of the following year<ref name="gen ciri">[https://web.archive.org/web/20000418190405/http://sapkowski.fantasy.art.pl/wc/ciri/ciri.html.po Genealogy of Ciri - Cirilla]</ref> and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor [[Mousesack]] to kill Geralt,<ref>In the English translation, the sentence reads such that Calanthe wanted Mousesack to kill the baby and he planned to leave rather than do it. However in the original Polish, Calanthe wanted the druid to kill Geralt instead and he was willing to do so as nobody refused the queen.</ref> wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.<ref name="sod">{{SoD}}</ref>

Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, though it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against [[Calanthe]]'s wishes, who wished for them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the [[Sedna Abyss]], making Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old. Angry at her nephew-in-law, [[Crach an Craite]], for letting them sail out, Calanthe then had Crach swear a blood oath that he'd always protect Ciri before deciding to forbid Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months before Calanthe let Ciri visit Skellige once more every summer and winter.<ref name="ttots">{{TTotS}}</ref>

=== Cintra's Princess ===
With the death of her mother, Ciri was now the only remaining heir to Cintra and thus Calanthe took special care to raise her granddaughter. Despite Calanthe's attempts to keep Ciri shielded from learning about being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to be a witcher since birth, Ciri's nanny told the young girl all about a white-haired witcher, and that he'd one day come for her to be taken away to be trained as one as well. When Calanthe found out she was furious but by then the seeds had been sown and Ciri began to firmly believe that was her destiny.<ref name="sod" />

Then, 6 years almost to the day when Duny's curse was lifted, Geralt returned to Cintra but Calanthe, not wishing to lose her only remaining descendant, hid Ciri amongst a group of boys and had them playing around in the moat outside the castle when Geralt dropped in, who erroneously believed Pavetta had a son and wondered which one "he" was in the group. Despite this, he refused to take any child with him and left without even learning the true identity of Pavetta's child.

=== Entering Brokilon ===
Shortly after, Calanthe arranged an engagement between Ciri and [[Windhalm of Attre]], a now 20 year old who once vied for Pavetta's hand 7 years prior. However, Calanthe had a change in heart and called off the engagement years later<ref name="gen ciri" /> before setting up another one, this time to [[Kistrin]], the sole [[prince]] of [[Verden]]. However, the now 10 year old Ciri wasn't fond of this idea or of Kistrin and, no sooner had she arrived in Verden in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1263}} to meet her suitor and his family, did she escape with aid from [[Marck|some of the soldiers]]. This plan went awry though as the party got lost and ended up in the dreaded [[Brokilon]] region, a forest off-limits to anyone not friends with the [[dryad]]s that lived there. While normally the dryads shot to kill on sight, Ciri wasn't noticed by them, though the rest of her party wasn't so lucky and were killed as they mistakenly crossed the border.

While she wandered alone deeper into the dangerous forest, she was spotted by a [[giant centipede]] and almost met her death there when her screams were heard by Geralt and [[Braenn]] as they were incidentally nearby. After they killed the giant centipede though, Ciri tried to take off but immediately stopped when Braenn nearly hit her with an arrow. Despite this, the young princess refused to answer them and went as far as stating she'd have both of them beheaded before eventually joining them in their trek to [[Duén Canell]], all the while telling Geralt how she didn't want a husband and threatening to bite Geralt to get him to answer her questions before the witcher threatened to whip her with his belt, making her behave politely the rest of the trip.

When the group arrived in Duén Canell, Ciri met the injured [[Freixenet]], who also wished to beat the young princess for running away, before the governor revealed that Geralt was a witcher. Before Ciri could ask further on this, Braenn started to lead the princess away and Ciri realized they were preparing to make her a dryad and began to cry, though allowed herself to be led away.

A few hours later, Ciri sat with the dryad queen, [[Eithné]], in her home. As Geralt arrived to discuss his reason for being sent to Brokilon, it eventually turned to Ciri, who was to be made a dryad. However, Ciri had already told Eithné something she hadn't revealed to Geralt yet: that she was destined to be a witcher and on learning who Geralt was, she realized she was destined to him. As Geralt made to leave rather than watch the young girl drink the [[Water of Brokilon]] that'd erase all her previous memories, Ciri begged him to stay and so he did for her sake. As he watched though, Ciri didn't show any of the normal signs after drinking the water and when the dryad queen asked the young girl who she wanted to go with, she revealed she still wished to go with Geralt, and thus the queen allowed the two to leave.

Geralt, now realizing Ciri was his Child of Surprise, traveled with her out of the forest, though when he took off east to [[Brugge]] Ciri appeared uncomfortable, remarking she felt they were going the wrong way, but followed anyways. A short time later it appeared she was correct: they ran into a group of King [[Ervyll]]'s soldiers who were staging a merchant robbery as an act by the dryads. Not aware of the situation, Ciri suddenly remarked the dryads couldn't have done it as the tree was cut down, causing the men to try and kill her and Geralt, but Geralt held them off as he demanded she run. Instead of running far though, Ciri instead took an earlier story Geralt told to heart and climbed all the way up a tree. After the mercenaries were killed off by Geralt, nearby dryads, and the arrival of Mousesack, Ciri rejoined them, though the druid remarked Calanthe would probably be ready to spank the girl despite being sent by Calanthe to call off Ciri and Kistrin's engagement.

That night though, Geralt tried to take off once more without Ciri, who awoke after he rode off and yelled after him not to go and that she was his destiny. However, Geralt didn't turn around, leaving Mousesack to take her back to Cintra.<ref name="sod" />

=== Adventures in Skellige ===
Shortly after Ciri traveled back to Skellige and at one point became extremely infatuated with one of the kingdom's famous warriors, [[Olaf Stigvason]]. However, this love was never meant to be as he was 35 years old, married, and with children older than Ciri. Distraught at this, Ciri decided she'd commit suicide by drowning and waited for favorable weather conditions to do so. This took too long though and during the wait, she was able to overcome her infatuation with the warrior.<ref name="gen ciri" />

Sometime later that season, she saw some of the boys, including a 15 year old [[Hjalmar an Craite]], playing a game on the ice where they'd try to see how many rocks in a row they could jump over while skating. Hjalmar held the current record until Ciri, extremely agile and fast, beat it. Not to be outdone, Hjalmar tried to beat Ciri's record but smashed into the ice instead, breaking several bones in the process. Despite this, Hjalmar held no grudges against Ciri and the young girl regularly visited him while he healed. Being young and naïve, the two soon got "engaged" but as soon as Crach heard of this he promptly broke them up as Calanthe had other plans in the works to marry Ciri off and the young girl was dragged back home to Cintra by her grandmother.<ref name="ttots" />

Shortly after, Calanthe arranged Ciri's third official engagement: this time to the 9 year old [[Radovid V]] of [[Redania]]. Before the children ever had a chance to meet though, Radovid's father, [[Vizimir II]], called off the engagement 6 months later.<ref name="gen ciri" />

=== Fall of Cintra ===
In {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1263}}, the [[Nilfgaardian Empire]], which had been taking over kingdoms in the south for some time, eventually decided to move on Cintra. During the final push, Ciri found herself barricaded in the [[Cintra (city)|capital]]'s castle with her grandmother and many of the nobles, with no chance of surviving as it was only a matter of time when the Nilfgaardian soldiers would break in. Unknown to her and her grandmother, there was also a Nilfgaardian spy in the castle and so when Calanthe had some of her soldiers try to flee with the young Ciri, the spy signaled to the invaders that she was escaping.<ref name="ttots" />

Ciri's escorts ran into [[Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach]]'s group and a chase through the burning city unfolded before Cahir's men eventually caught up with the Cintran guards and a fight ensued. As both Nilfgaardians and Cintrans alike died, a frightened Ciri was dropped to the ground and barely escaped from being stabbed herself. Still in a daze, Ciri soon found herself alone with Cahir, the only other survivor out of the fight and distinguished by his winged helmet. As he picked up Ciri, she began to scream before fainting. A short time later she came to as Cahir had managed to escape the city with her, but with Cahir not knowing her language, nothing helped ease her mind. Later that night, when the two went to sleep, she managed to slip away from him.

Now alone, Ciri ended up wandering the forests of [[Riverdell]] for two weeks, staying with a family of four in [[Kagen]] who taught her to spin yarn, before finding a group of fugitives and staying with them for a month<ref name="boe">{{BoE}}</ref> before she was eventually taken in by [[druid]]s, as they tended to take in homeless children as a result of the war.<ref name="sod" /> A short time later, [[Goldencheeks]] took her in and so Ciri moved in with the woman and her family in [[Lower Sodden]]. While Ciri didn't reveal who she was and where she was from, Goldencheeks took a liking to the girl over the next six months,<ref name="boe" /> especially as she herself couldn't bear anymore children and only had sons. As fate would have it though, Goldencheeks' husband, [[Yurga]], was out on a trip during this time and was rescued by Geralt, who didn't know what else to ask for as a reward and so enacted the Law of Surprise. When Yurga brought the witcher back to his place in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1264}} and learned of the unexpected girl his wife had taken in, Ciri suddenly spotted Geralt and cried out to him before the two ran to each other, reuniting once more.<ref name="sod" />

=== Training at Kaer Morhen ===
In {{Year|year=1265|canon=yes}}, with Geralt now accepting Ciri as his destiny, he took the young girl with him to [[Kaer Morhen]], both to keep her in hiding and to train her to be a witcher. During the trip there, Ciri was often plagued by nightmares of the knight with the winged helmet and Geralt had to reassure her everything was ok while holding her close until she fell asleep. When they finally arrived that autumn, the princess was initially afraid of the witchers but as soon as Geralt confirmed she was their destiny she began to see the small group as family and friends. That same night that they arrived though, the witchers quickly learned Ciri was no ordinary child. Thirsty, Ciri grabbed the nearest drink off the table, and before the witchers could stop her, she accidentally drank [[White Seagull]] which, combined with her [[Elder Blood]], sent Ciri into a trance, speaking in another voice but incoherently.<ref name="boe" />

A bit uneasy by this but not able to do anything else, the witchers, including Geralt, [[Vesemir]], [[Lambert]], [[Eskel]], and [[Coën]], began to train Ciri as a witcher. They used special mushrooms and herbs found in the valley to accelerate both her physical and hormonal progression as a witcher, allowing her much more strength and agility for her size. However, during one training episode she fell and once more went into an incomprehensible trance. It was only the third one, during one of her many nightmares, that she began to speak coherently, prophesying Coën's and Geralt's deaths. However like all the previous ones, Ciri never remembered them nor what she said so the witchers never told her about the episodes.

Regardless, the witchers needed help understanding what was happening to Ciri and so in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1265}} they sent for the [[sorceress]] [[Triss Merigold]], as Geralt didn't wish to involve [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] due to how they last split up. By December, Triss arrived in time to see a now 12 year old Ciri running the [[The Killer|Trail]], an obstacle course around the keep, but as Ciri made to jump the [[Gullet]] portion, she landed wrong and Triss ran over. While initially scared of the unknown woman, Ciri eventually let the sorceress heal her wound before the two made their way to the keep. As they did so, Triss witnessed firsthand one of Ciri's trances, this time predicting Triss' death, before Ciri woke up, believing she'd fallen asleep.

The next day, Triss went with Ciri to her room to inspect the young girl while fixing up her clothes, which had been haphazardly put together by Vesemir. As they talked, Ciri eventually confided she was scared of some of the training equipment before revealing something she'd been too embarrassed to bring up to the men: her menstruation had begun and, with no other women around, had no idea what was going on. With Triss' guidance, Ciri went and informed the witchers that she was "indisposed" and wouldn't be doing any physical training until it'd passed. Then, following Triss' earlier instructions, asked for Triss to be allowed to stay, before excusing herself. With that, Triss set forth a condition that the witchers stop feeding Ciri their special herbs and mushrooms as, while they helped with fitness and building muscle, they could have adverse effects on Ciri's womanly attributes as she grew up.

On [[Midwinter]] night, as Coën kept Ciri distracted with a game, Triss revealed Ciri was a [[Source]], leading to initial denial as the witchers pointed out Ciri couldn't even do basic [[sign]]s. However, Triss revealed that Sources were only transmitters of magic and therefore had no actual control over it: if they tried to force it nothing came out, but a strong emotion could unexpectedly flatten half a town. After the witchers revealed to Triss Ciri's past trances, Coën came through with Ciri and Triss gave the young girl White Seagull to send her into a trance once more, with the aim to find out what was speaking through her. Triss soon learned though that whatever was speaking through Ciri was extremely powerful, too powerful for Triss to control and stop it if it ever burst through Ciri. Naturally, Ciri didn't remember any of it and, despite not knowing enough [[Elder Speech]] to make sentences, as she was coming out of the trance she spoke in the tongue to say "something is ending." Knowing they needed help from a more experienced mage, Geralt finally relented in asking for Yennefer's help come spring, as they planned to take Ciri to [[Ellander]]'s [[Temple of Melitele (Ellander)|Temple of Melitele]] for schooling.

As the winter went on, Ciri continued her witcher training while also taking Elder Speech lessons from Triss, the latter of whom kept an eye on the girl every day and night to make sure whatever spoke through Ciri didn't come back, while also soothing her back to sleep when she woke up from nightmares. At one point the witchers even made a custom sword for Ciri to match her build.

One night in the middle of February {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1266}} though, Ciri slipped down and eavesdropped on a conversation Triss was having with the witchers in regards to their indifference to politics and went into detail about what happened during the [[Battle of Sodden Hill]]. As Ciri ran in, proclaiming she'd stand by Triss in fighting the Nilfgaardians as they'd killed her grandmother, Ciri revealed she thought she was training to kill, as she wanted to kill the winged helmet knight that haunted her dreams. Geralt sharply chastised her, informing her they were training her to save lives, not to kill out of fear and hatred, before sending her out of the room.

Distraught, Ciri ran out into the courtyard and stopped on the ledge of one of the walls where she inspected her sword. As Geralt and Triss approached, she cried out that nobody was going to take her sword from her, but as she moved, she lost her footing and almost fell to her death but Geralt caught her in the nick of time. After speaking comforting words to Ciri, the three agreed it was time to head south to the temple in Ellander.

=== Traveling to Ellander ===
As the trio made their way through [[Kaedwen]], Triss suddenly fell ill from food poisoning, preventing them from being able to ride for very long as they had to keep making stops for her. At one point they reached an outpost that was overflowing with merchants and soldiers and, despite Geralt sending Ciri to look after Triss, the girl showed back up in time to overhear one of the commandants vehemently proclaiming all [[nonhuman]]s were in cahoots with the [[Scoia'tael]] and Nilfgaard had been backing them. Before more could be said, the trio were asked to leave as, despite Triss not being contagious, the soldiers didn't want to take the chance. One of the soldiers though pointed them in the direction of a convoy that was headed in the same general direction and who might be able to better assist Triss.

Within a day, they'd caught up with the convoy who were made up of old [[Dwarf|dwarven]] acquaintances of Geralt's and were now following King [[Henselt]]'s orders to deliver a special order. As they traveled with [[Yarpen Zigrin]] and [[Yarpen Zigrin's company|his group]], Ciri eavesdropped a few times on their conversations, particularly when Scoia'tael were mentioned, as Yarpen was adamantly against them, despite being nonhuman himself.

At one point, when Geralt headed to the back of the convoy, Ciri sat up front with Yarpen and, after being shown how to steer the wagon, asked Yarpen about his earlier conversation with Geralt, namely what he meant by the witcher being indifferent before she figured out that Yarpen was between a rock and hard place: being nonhuman he wasn't accepted by [[human]]s but by helping a human king, he was a traitor in the Scoia'tael eyes.

As the trip continued, she and Geralt both took care of the still ailing, but now recovering, Triss. However, Ciri became annoyed when the other dwarves wrongly assumed that Triss and Geralt were a couple, and was further annoyed with Triss when the sorceress appeared to try and snuggle up rather too much to Geralt when they helped bathe her. After being asked by Geralt to leave during one such episode, Ciri bumped into Yarpen and asked who was right in the fight between the Scoia'tael and humans. After a while, Yarpen finally noted that he'd like to live in a way where he didn't have to ask for forgiveness and everyone would learn to live next to each other. With that, Ciri remarked how Yarpen wasn't all that different from her.

The next day, Geralt let Ciri ride a bit ahead of the convoy but, being anxious just to run off for a short while, she galloped way ahead of the convoy to take in the silence and surroundings and soon made her way a bit off the main road. As she enjoyed the forest area she began to think how she'd never be indifferent, that she intended to save defenseless people from evil, like the horrors she saw during the war, and couldn't understand why Geralt and the other witchers were neutral about it.

While thinking this over, she suddenly ducked down beneath a bush and none too soon as, across the clearing, a large band of Scoia'tael appeared and began to move through the area. When they were finally gone and she felt safe, Ciri popped back up only for Geralt to grab her to keep her from screaming in surprise. As Geralt instructed her back to the horses, he told her not to say a word of what she saw to the others and and that the trio would depart from the convoy tomorrow. Infuriated and not understanding his indifference in this, Ciri questioned Geralt about it, who calmly told her the Scoia'tael group wasn't there for the convoy, but something else. He then led her to [[Shaerrawedd]], an ancient elven palace now in ruins. However, in the center of the ruins still remained a statue of [[Aelirenn]], an elf that'd tried to lead one last desperate battle against humans 200 years ago. While the elders didn't wish to, feeling they could wait out humanity with their long lifespans, Aelirenn was able to rally most of the younger elves, and the only ones able to still have offspring. The fight ended in a massacre and thus doomed the elven race to annihilation.

Finally understanding that witcher neutrality wasn't about being insensitive but rather to prevent more unnecessary massacres, Ciri then asked to take one of the special roses to remember. As she did though, she pricked herself and suddenly realized the rest of the convoy was under attack and the two galloped back to get to Triss.

As the two arrived, the convoy was indeed under attack by Scoia'tael and, ignoring Geralt's orders to head into the woods, Ciri hurried to Triss and pulled her into cover while the fighting continued all around them. While initially protected by the others around her, soon Ciri found herself alone, face to face with an elf, and now without her sword. As the elf moved in though, she spotted Shaerrawedd's rose on Ciri, causing enough hesitation for Geralt to come from behind and kill the elf before Ciri passed out. When she came to, the group had been rescued by [[Dun Banner]], another Kaedwenian military unit, but soon learned the whole convoy had been a trap: wanting to test Yarpen's loyalty, they were actually given common stone to transport while another tipped off the Scoia'tael about the "special" convoy so they'd attack it. As Geralt and Ciri looked on at the fallen acquaintances and Scoia'tael members, Geralt threw the now blood stained rose onto the elf he'd killed earlier to protect Ciri, with Ciri saying goodbye as Geralt asked for forgiveness.<ref name="boe" />

=== Training with Yennefer ===
After the chaos with the convoy, the three had a far more peaceful trip to the Temple of Melitele and once there, Geralt left Ciri in [[Nenneke]]'s care, while he wrote to [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] about the situation and asked for her help in teaching Ciri.

While Yennefer made her way to the temple, Ciri was treated like any other pupil, sleeping in a dormitory with the other students, while learning about history, nature, poetry, prose, runes, the [[Elder Speech]], and doing chores. When she could, she'd also write to Geralt to tell him about the goings-on.

After Yennefer arrived, Ciri at first openly didn't like her as the sorceress was quite cold, though they quickly started to develop a mother-daughter bond, and she spent more and more time with the sorceress, doing chores only two days a week, and seeing her friends rarely. Yennefer pushed the girl putting her through many tests, and taught her about muscles and bones, about balance and how to control one's breathing. She also taught Ciri about [[magic]] and [[Chaos]] and how to control it. One night, after being worn out from several days of intense training with Yennefer, she had a dream about Geralt, [[Shani]] and [[Dandelion]], awaking to Yennefer arguing with Nenneke about the sorceress' training methods, and so forced herself back to sleep. Some time later, while doing chores with her new friends [[Iola the Second]] and [[Eurneid]], she was told about the rising political tension and the possibility of a [[Northern War II|second northern war]], which made her curious so she went and saw [[Jarre]], Nenneke's ward. He told her of the geography of the area, and the potential of the second war, which he believed was unlikely. After Jarre's awkward flirting started to make Ciri irritated, she ran to Yennefer who told her they were to leave the following morning, for solitude at the magic school of [[Aretuza]].<ref name="boe" />

=== Journey to Aretuza ===
In late June {{Year|year=1267|canon=yes}}, after a night at an inn in [[Ellander]], Ciri and Yennefer were preparing to leave when Ciri entered a trance and foretold the messenger [[Aplegatt]] of his death on hot sands. The following night was spent at an inn in the [[Temeria]]n town of [[Anchor]]. After three days more ride, they arrived in [[Gors Velen]], where Yennefer hid Ciri's identity so they could visit [[Giancardi Bank]], where [[Molnar Giancardi]] told them of the politics of the continent and paid for Ciri's tuition in Ellander, and her future tuition at Aretuza. Molnar then summoned [[Fabio Sachs]], his apprentice who could take Ciri on a tour of the city. They saw the [[Fish market (Gors Velen)|fish market]] and then Fabio showed her [[Thanedd Island]] from the city walls. Finally they went to the [[Gors Velen marketplace|marketplace]], where many great wonders amazed the girl, such as camels. After listening to a priest preach about the Aretuza mages, the holy man proceeded to grope Ciri, who screamed at him in the square, only calmed by Fabio taking her for food. As Fabio went to get his fortune told, Ciri lapsed into another trance and foretold his life as an explorer and death in an [[Western Continent|unnamed continent]]. While continuing to look through the market, the two came across a man advertising his "[[basilisk]]" from [[Zerrikania]], which intrigued Ciri, so they went in. The basilisk ended up being a [[wyvern]], which Ciri kept mentioning to the man, to the point of him of challenging her to survive the creature's venom as a test. She freely walked up and proved the man wrong, though as she walked back the wyvern broke out of its small cage, attacking its owner. Ciri, using her training from Kaer Morhen, made quick work of the creature, and luckily protecting her identity, the crowd thought it was the work of a young squire standing nearby. Angry at her for "angering the beast", the crowd chased her away from the market, and she used the amulet given to her by Yennefer for disguisement, giving off magical interference that summoned [[Tissaia de Vries]] and [[Margarita Laux-Antille]]. They believed Ciri was an escaped student from Aretuza and so Tissaia put her under a paralysis spell and with Fabio's advice carried the girl to Giancardi Bank, where Yennefer confirmed her identity.<ref name="toc" />

Tissaia apologised and invited them to [[The Silver Heron]] inn, where they all proceeded to spend several hours bathing. As the sorceresses started to get drunk, Ciri left the cellar and convinced the innkeeper to give her a [[horse]], left a note for Yennefer, and rode west toward Geralt's last known location, [[Hirundum]]. Throughout the stormy trip she had flashbacks to Cintra and the black knight, to Shaerrawedd, and then even saw glimpses of the [[Wild Hunt]] attempting to recruit her. By the time she arrived at the farm and saw Geralt and then Yennefer, who followed her via portal, she was extremely exhausted and fainted. The following morning she snuck out of the Hofmeier house and eavesdropped on her two mentors talking, which was quickly caught onto by [[Dandelion]], the bard friend of Geralt. Eventually things were summarised and Yennefer invited Ciri and the witcher to the [[Thanedd coup|Conclave of Mages]] on Thanedd.<ref name="toc" />

===Thanedd Coup===
Things did not work out as planned though. There was a coup during the conference and several individuals including Vilgefortz and Cahir tried to capture Ciri once again, and once again failed with the girl escaping through an unstable magical portal in [[Tor Lara]]. Because of the portal's nature, Ciri was simply ejected in mid-air over the [[Korath desert]].

Unaware of where she was and without obvious recourse, the girl decided to make her way out of the wasteland by heading west. Unfortunately she wandered around in circles for some time before deciding to use the stars as a guide. She nearly died of exhaustion, dehydration and starvation. Luckily for her she met a [[Unicorn (creature)|unicorn]] whom she nicknamed [[Ihuarraquax|Little Horse]] that helped her out of the desert. She used [[Fire]] magic to heal her companion, and while other unicorns, quietly observing her actions, were unpleased with utilising its power, they decided not to kill her because of saving one of their own. Ciri went unconsious due to [[Pyromancy|pyromantic]] visions.

=== The Rats ===
Next day, [[Sweers]] and his [[Trappers]] find her and (after a short conflict with one of Sweers' sworn enemies) brought her to safety in [[Glyswen]]. Ciri, who was still undergoing an emotional tribulation, then helped the [[Rats]], a group of ne'er-do-wells, to rescue their member [[Kayleigh]]. She named herself [[Falka (alias)|Falka]] after the [[Falka|woman she saw in pyromantic vision]]. In the night Kayleigh wanted to "thank" Ciri by trying to force her to have sex with him, but was stopped by [[Mistle]] who wanted Ciri for her own. Despite sexual assaults Ciri stayed with the rats and even developed a romantic relationship with Mistle even while sometimes claiming she did no longer like what Mistle had done to her.<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref>

During their travels, the Rats attacked a convoy of [[Baron of Casadei|Baron]] of [[Casadei]]'s daughter. The baron hired a bounty hunter [[Leo Bonhart]] to capture her alive; however, Bonhart was already hired by [[Stefan Skellen]] who wanted her to be killed<ref name="bof">{{BoF}}</ref> so that the monarchy could be overthrown.<ref name="tlotl">{{TLotL}}</ref>

Bonhart killed the Rats and cut off their heads after their deaths. The hunter neither killed Ciri, nor brought her to Baron Casadei, therefore not fullfilling both contracts. Instead he imprisoned her for some time, beating her, mistreating and forcing her to kill in the [[Arena in Claremont|arena]] at [[Claremont]], which belonged to his cousin [[Dominik Bombastus Houvenaghel|Houvenaghel]].

On [[Velen (holiday)|Velen]] Ciri managed to escape with the help of [[Vattier de Rideaux|Vattier]]'s spy [[Neratin Ceka]] when Bonhart had taken her to the village of [[Unicorn (village)|Unicorn]] on the eve of [[Velen (holiday)|the equinox]]. He had gone here to meet with Skellen and [[Rience]] and possibly negotiate some terms to release Ciri. Bonhart then killed Neratin, and Skellen seriously wounded Ciri, disfiguring her with an [[orion]] as she fled the village on her mare, [[Kelpie]].

Later, she was found, near death by [[Vysogota of Corvo]], who hid and healed her at his hermitage in the [[Pereplut]] swamp. She stayed with Vysogota until shortly after [[Saovine]] when she set off to find the [[Tor Zireael|Swallow's Tower]], believed to be a twin tower to Tor Lara, so that she could return to Thanedd. Together with Skellen and Rience, Bonhart tried to hunt her down on the order of [[Vilgefortz]], but she managed to escape due to the intervention of the [[Wild Hunt]] which scared off Bonhart's horse. Ciri entered the tower and was teleported to the world of the [[Aen Elle]] elves.<ref name="ttots">{{TTotS}}</ref>

=== The Aen Elle ===
There she was greeted by [[Avallac'h]], an [[Aen Saevherne]]. He explained to her that she had to 'pay the debt' referring to the perceived loss to the Aen Elle when [[Lara Dorren]] took [[Cregennan of Lod]] as her lover. The elves believed that the latter had 'stolen' Elder Blood from them by marrying Lara. To atone for that 'crime' Avallac'h wanted Ciri to beget a child with [[Auberon Muircetach]], the king of the Aen Elle. That being the only way Avallac'h would let her return to her own world. On their way to [[Tir ná Lia]], the Aen Elle capital, they met [[Eredin]] and his [[Dearg Ruadhri]]. Ciri was initially quite infatuated with him - he realised that and tried to use it to control her. They also came across a pack of unicorns which appeared to be at cold war with Aen Elle.

In Tir ná Lia Ciri finally met Auberon, who many times tries to conceive a child with her, however he could not - to him she was just a human, a being of no interest for an Aen Elle. Nevertheless, he was very proud and refused to admit it. Eredin suggested using a 'potion' which would improve Auberon's performance and allow him to conceive a child with Cirilla. He also told her the truth (probably to gain her trust) - that Avallac'h would never let her go. Knowing this, Ciri found help with the unicorns where she also met Little Horse/Ihuarraquax, by then fully grown. The unicorns explained that both Fox and Sparrowhawk had once possessed [[The Gate of the Worlds]], a mystical power known only to those of the Elder Blood but they had lost it. Now they wanted these powers back and for that they needed Ciri. This could not be allowed, however, and the unicorns explained to Cirilla how she should escape.

That same day Ciri once again visited Auberon only to find that he had drunk the 'potion' given to him by Eredin. Unknown to Sparrowhawk it happened to be too strong and killed Auberon. That night Ciri attempted to escape Tir ná Lia and its barrier by using a boat and swimming with the river's current. She was stopped by Eredin who then revealed his true intentions, being the same as Avallac'h's. The two battled and Ciri proved victorious due to the elf's underestimation of her abilities - she wounded him and threw him into the river. Later on she mounted Kelpie and rode away from Tir ná Lia. She met Horsey, who was in fact named [[Ihuarraquax]] and offered his help (actually his being by Ciri's side was a part of her bargain with the other unicorns). They came across a huge pile of bones.

To her horror, Ciri realized that the skulls had human teeth making them a pile of human bones. Ihuarraquax explained that it had been a human world until the elves led by Fox and Sparrowhawk arrived and killed them all - this also would be the fate of other worlds, including Ciri's own, should Avallac'h and Eredin succeed in once again harnessing the power of time and space. Nevertheless, Ihuarraquax and Ciri realized that they were being chased.

Little Horse urged Ciri to jump to another world - the only way to escape. She, however, didn't know how. The unicorn became her guide and they jumped. This led to the manifestation of Ciri's strongest power, giving her the title of The Lady of the Worlds. That power allowed her to traverse space and time at will. Not being able to control it, however, Ciri had to journey through [[Multiverse|many different worlds]] to finally find [[world|her own]]. She traveled to [[Stygga Castle]] to give herself to Vilgefortz in exchange for Yennefer's freedom. However, when she arrives there, he refuses to release Yennefer and instead reveals his plan to impregnate her and use her placenta to gain access to the Elder Blood. She was saved by Geralt and his hansa and later the [[Impera Brigade]] under the command of Emperor [[Emhyr var Emreis]] himself; during the ensuing battle, Ciri encountered and battled Leo Bonhart, using her training from Kaer Morhen to outmaneuvre, then seriously injure the bounty hunter. Bonhart seemingly succeeded in convincing Ciri to spare his life, insisting she was too noble to kill a beaten, unarmed man but Ciri ultimately killed Bonhart in self-defence when he made a last attempt to attack her from behind. While Emhyr revealed to Geralt that he too had intended to impregnate Ciri, after sending Geralt and Yennefer away, he instead informed Ciri that he is her father and leaves Stygga Castle.

Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri then set out from Stygga Castle and travel; first, they visit [[Jealousy]], where she visits the graves of the Rats. Yennefer then left for [[Vengerberg]], and Geralt and Ciri traveled to [[Toussaint]]. As they arrived, they found Dandelion, about to be executed for angering [[Anna Henrietta]] by falling in love with another woman. He was pardoned, and Geralt advised that they leave before she could change her mind and decide to order his execution again. Ciri was then summoned to Vengerberg by Yennefer, and Geralt told her to meet him in [[Rivia (city)|Rivia]] in six days' time.

=== The Lodge ===
After traveling to Vengerberg, she and Yennefer were invited to the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]] in [[Montecalvo]], where they revealed their plans to send Ciri to [[Kovir]] under a false name to have a child with [[Tankred Thyssen]], the only son of [[Esterad Thyssen]]. She expressed that she wished to think it over during her travel to Rivia as she had already agreed to meet Geralt there. [[Philippa Eilhart]] proclaimed that her ability to leave Montecalvo and travel to Rivia is dependent on what the Lodge decides, so she put it to a vote; [[Sheala de Tancarville]], [[Sabrina Glevissig]], [[Keira Metz]] and [[Assire var Anahid]] voted against her leaving Montecalvo, while Triss, [[Margarita Laux-Antille]], [[Francesca Findabair]], [[Ida Emean aep Sivney]], [[Fringilla Vigo]], and eventually even Philippa Eilhart herself voted in favor of letting her leave. She then traveled with Yennefer and Triss to Rivia.

They arrive in Rivia in the midst of the [[Rivian Pogrom]], and Ciri rushed into the crowd to try and find Geralt. After Yennefer and Triss released a [[Merigold's Hailstorm|hailstorm]] on the city and stopped the riot, they found Geralt impaled and bleeding out on the ground. After Ciri yelled at Yennefer because her magic was unable to save Geralt, the sorceress lost her consciousness. Ihuarraquax appeared on the lakeshore; his horn started emitting a light which was directed by Ciri on Geralt and Yennefer. The unicorn pointed to a boat; she put an unconscious Geralt and Yennefer in the boat and got in it with them. Geralt came to on [[Malus Island]], and Yennefer informed him that Ciri had left.

After leaving Rivia with Geralt and Yennefer, she traveled to a [[Earth (world)|different world]] where she met a knight by the name of Sir [[Galahad]] who invited her to King [[Arthur]]'s court at [[Camelot]]. She agreed, and the two rode off together, heading to Camelot through the lands of [[Y Dynan Bach Têg]].<ref name="tlotl" />

=== Returning Home ===
{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}Having hidden in another world for over half a year the Wild Hunt found Ciri, forcing her to flee. At some point Ciri discovered that Geralt had been captured by the Wild Hunt and managed to free him and send him to the forests outside of Kaer Morhen although he lost his memory in the process. Several months later Ciri, along with an [[elf]] named Avallac'h, returned from another world and ended up in Skellige where the Wild Hunt found and attacked them. Avallac'h was cursed during this attack before the two could teleport away, but were split up in the process.

Ciri appeared in [[Crookback Bog]] where she collapsed and was found by the [[Crones]]. The Crones intended to give her to the Wild Hunt however, as she possessed [[Elder blood]], they couldn't decide whether to cut her up for her blood or not. Having overheard this, Ciri escaped and fled into the nearby forest, narrowly evading [[Imlerith]]. Traveling west into [[Velen]], she encountered a young girl named [[Gretka]] who was lost and rescued her as well as a local man from a werewolf. She was then taken to [[Crow's Perch]] and taken in by [[Phillip Strenger]] (known as the ''Bloody Baron'') who alongside his men she befriended. During a race with Philip, the two are attacked by a [[basilisk]] and Ciri was forced to use her powers to save him. However, Ciri realized that Wild Hunt would sense her powers so she left Crow's Perch and headed to [[Novigrad]].

Ciri tracked down [[Dandelion]] to enlist his help in repairing a phylactery to lift the curse on Avallac'h, though she excluded the identity of her friend. After evading a trap set by the [[Temple Guard]], Dandelion suggested going to [[Cyprian Wiley|Cyprian "Whoreson Junior" Wiley]], who agreed to fix the phylactery in exchange for stealing [[Sigismund Dijkstra|Sigi Reuven]]'s treasure. Wiley later turned on them, capturing and torturing their friend [[Dudu]]. Ciri managed to rescue Dudu but her activities got the attention of the Temple Guard, who chased her towards Temple Isle. Just as a crossbowman took a shot at her, Ciri teleported herself to safety.

Ciri teleported all the way to Skellige, landing on the shores of [[Hindarsfjall]], where she fell unconscious, dropping into a lake. Avallac'h and a native Skelliger, [[Skjall]], found the injured girl and took her to Skjall's home to recover. When she came to, Ciri accepted the invitation to heal at the local sauna. But soon as she prepared to depart, the Wild Hunt descended on the village, forcing Ciri to flee once more. She found her way to Avallac'h, who was waiting with a boat. But upon seeing Skjall being cut down by a Red Rider, she attempted to turn back to help him, but Avallac'h stunned her with a sleeping spell and took her on a ship.

Before Eredin's curse fully triggered, Avallac'h managed to bring Ciri to the [[Isle of Mists]] and put Ciri in a death-like slumber to hide her from the Wild Hunt. Avallac'h then sailed back to Skellige but the curse took hold, rendering it impossible for him to tell anyone who he was or where he hid Ciri. While Ciri slept, seven dwarves found her in the cabin and hid there as well, though they believed she was dead.

Later on, Ciri was finally found by Geralt and once she was awakened by the magical firefly the witcher was given by a cured Avallac'h, the two embraced and caught up on all that'd happened when Ciri tried to return home, including what'd she learned: the Aen Elle world was facing annihilation and so the King of the Wild Hunt was trying to catch Ciri to use her to open a powerful enough portal to allow an army through to conquer their world.

As they prepare to leave, they discover the dwarves hadn't bothered to wait and took Geralt's boat to flee the Isle, before spotting the Wild Hunt's flagship, the Naglfar, in the distance, forcing Ciri to teleport them directly to Kaer Morhen.

Upon arrival, Ciri happily reunited with Vesemir, Yennefer, and Triss. However, the time for celebration was cut short, as the Hunt would soon assault the aging keep. Despite wanting to fight in the upcoming battle, Ciri was ordered to remain inside the keep while everyone else defended her. However, Ciri defied this order when she saw Triss come under attack by Wild Hunt warriors and rushed to her aid. She later assisted Eskel against Caranthir, before the general heard a war horn signaling him to retreat.

[[File:Ciri scream at Kaer Morhen.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Ciri's crippling scream at Kaer Morhen.]]As the Wild Hunt breached Kaer Morhen's inner courtyard, they released a powerful blast of the White Frost, freezing everyone save for Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been behind a wall and thus weren't touched by the blast. Imlerith then attacked the pair and managed to pin Vesemir down, forcing Ciri to drop her weapon and go with Eredin willingly or they'd kill the old witcher. However, not wanting Ciri to give herself up, Vesemir made one last attack at Imlerith, stabbing him and causing Imlerith to snap Vesemir's neck, instantly killing the witcher. Distraught at this, Ciri's Elder Blood powers suddenly broke free in an uncontrollable, crippling scream, making everything gravitate towards her while the intensity of the magic killed anyone that got too close. Nonetheless, Eredin futilely tried to get closer to try and capture Ciri but was dragged back from her by Caranthir and disappeared through a portal. A weakened Avallac'h then appeared from his room in the keep and managed to intervene and stop Ciri's powers before they destroyed the entire keep and everyone else there.

Back in control of herself, Ciri attended Vesemir's funeral pyre with the rest but started to regret returning to Kaer Morhen and, despite Geralt's attempts to calm her, she snatched Vesemir's [[Witcher medallion|medallion]] off the pyre and ran off. She returned a shor time later to find Geralt, Avallac'h, Yennefer, and Triss discussing reassembling the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]] to fight the Wild Hunt and became incensed that decisions were being made without her and left once more.

Trying to use the small window they had to recover, Ciri continued to train with Avallac'h but was disheartened that she wasn't progressing well, especially with Vesemir's death fresh on her mind.

Ciri later stirs Geralt early in the morning, revealing she had discovered Imlerith was attending a sabbath on [[Bald Mountain (location)|Bald Mountain]] in Velen, as would the Crones, though she hadn't told Avallac'h of her plans. Geralt can suggest visiting her biological father, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, in [[Vizima]] first or go to Bald Mountain immediately.

If Geralt and Ciri go to meet Emhyr, the latter addresses her by all her titles as nobles and soldiers kneel before her. He then presents the second half of Geralt's payment as thanks for finding his daughter. Whether Geralt accepts or not affects Ciri. Ciri then engages in a private conversation with Emhyr but later stormed out, angry at his attempts to buy her.

A few weeks later, Geralt and Ciri arrive at Bald Mountain and are forced to contend with the local celebration, which ends in them being sent to a [[sylvan]] named [[Fugas]] for execution. After slaying the monster, Ciri plays a game of rock, paper, scissors, to decide who will face the Crones and who would slay Imlerith. Ciri lost the game and thus went to confront the Crones. She interrupts them while they were stirring a cauldron full of human remains, prompting them to transform from beautiful women into their true, hideous forms. Ciri managed to slay Brewess and Whispess but Weavess managed to escape with Vesemir's medallion.

Their mission a success, the pair head for Novigrad, where Ciri had a multitude of personal matters to take care of. With Geralt, she revisits all the people she had encountered in the city. She was also present when Geralt and Avallac'h bring [[Ge'els]] from the world of the Aen Elle to show him proof that Eredin murdered the previous Aen Elle king, Auberon Muircetach, so he'd stop supporting the regicide. Ge'els attempt to sow animosity between Ciri and Avallac'h, but it fails. [[Corinne Tilly]], a oneiromancer, shows everyone through dreams of Eredin's regicide.

After [[Philippa Eilhart]] and [[Margarita Laux-Antille]] are gathered, they ask to meet with Ciri. If Geralt accompanies Ciri to the meeting, it undermines her confidence. The sorceresses extended an invitation for Ciri to join the Lodge as an equal partner.

The party then travels to Skellige to find an elven artifact called the Sunstone to lure Eredin into a trap. Ciri then expresses her desire to investigate Avallac'h secret laboratory in the isles, suspecting the elf to be hiding something from her. She goes ahead with Yennefer to await Geralt's arrival. After penetrating the laboratory, they find a genealogical chart of Elder Blood descendants; Avallac'h was studying all paths of Lara Dorren, even those thought extinct. They soon encounter a she-elf, claiming to be Avallac'h's lover, who proceeds to insult Ciri, calling her a degenerate half-breed and that Avallac'h despises that he needs her. Her words anger Ciri so much that she wants to tear up the lab. Geralt can support her and aid in the ransacking, cheering her up, or calm her down and fasten Lara Dorren's necklace around her neck, depressing her.

Once outside, Ciri asks to go to Hindarsfjall to see Skjall, only to be told of his death. If Geralt refuses, it depresses her. If he agrees to accompany her, they either meet up later or teleport there. Upon arrival, Ciri learns that Skjall was never buried, instead thrown on a corpse heap. After finding his corpse and giving it a proper burial, they are accosted by a band of villagers, who take issue with their defiance against their elders' writ, as Skjall was dishonored and his name stricken. Ciri threatens retaliation if Skjall's grave is disturbed and reveals Skjall's role in saving her from the Hunt, restoring his honor.

The party then sail to [[Undvik]] to spring the trap, with the Nilfgaardian fleet preventing the Naglfar from fleeing by sea and the sorceresses blocking their attempts to teleport. As the battle started, though advised to remain on shore, Ciri realized that Geralt and his Nilfgaardian detachment were frozen and decided to go out and assist. Avallac'h advised her to find Caranthir and break the jewel on his staff to lift the spell. After fighting through Hunt warriors and hounds did Ciri engage Caranthir, eventually destroying his staff, though the effort seemingly knocked her unconscious. Caranthir then attempted to grab Ciri, only for her to teleport away.

After Geralt mortally wounded Eredin, the elven king stated that Avallac'h had tricked them both, pitting them against each other while he made off with Ciri. When Geralt confronts Avallac'h as another [[Conjunction of the Spheres]] begins, but Avallac'h drops his sword proving that he did not betray them but was just following Ciri's wish to come here. Geralt then confronts Ciri who tells him that she has to go inside the portal to stop the White Frost. Depending on Geralt's interactions with her, Ciri may either survive or die stopping the White Frost.

If Ciri survives and didn't meet with Emhyr or met with Emhyr but Nilfgaard lost the war, Geralt will tell the Emperor that she died saving the world, before later meeting with Ciri to give her her witcher's blade. If Ciri survives and had met with Emhyr and Nilfgaard won the war, when Geralt meets with her in [[White Orchard]], she reveals that she has decided to take her place as Empress of Nilfgaard.

[[File:Tw3 journal ciri.png|thumb|250x250px]]
=== Journal Entry ===
:''Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon – what can I possibly say about her? That we call her Ciri for short, that she was born in 1251, that she has ashen hair and a scar on her cheek?''
:''All true, and that's the Cirilla I know best, the one I first laid eyes on those many years ago, the one who seemed thoroughly, well, not ordinary, but certainly not as extraordinary as she in fact is.''
:''For Cirilla is also a highly-skilled witcher, heiress to several thrones, the last bearer of the Elder Blood, a powerful Source endowed with exceptional magic talent and the Lady of Time and Space. Her hair color and date of birth seem... rather incidental now, don't they?''
:''I could also tell you she is Geralt's adopted daughter – but that would be a gross simplification. Ciri is much more. She is his Destiny, his Unexpected Child, someone bound to the witcher by Fate's most inextricably tangled fetters.''
:''Following age-old witcher tradition, Geralt took Ciri to Kaer Morhen when she came into his care. There he and Vesemir taught her in the ways of the professional monster slayer. It was then that her magic talents were first revealed, and they discovered she was a Source.''
:''Ciri's gift proved a curse as well. Because of it, she would one day have to hide from the entire world – even Geralt.''
:''Ciri's biography contained one more great secret. Her natural father was none other than the emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis. His words confirmed the fears swirling in Geralt's mind. Ciri had returned and was in mortal danger, for the unrelenting Wild Hunt was on her trail.''
:''Yennefer made it clear why the Wild Hunt wanted Ciri: Eredin wanted the power latent in her Elder Blood. She also let Geralt know that Ciri had been seen in war-ravaged Velen as well as in Novigrad, the largest city in the world.''
:''Reports that Ciri had spent time at Crow's Perch proved true. She was there as the guest of the local warlord, Phillip Strenger, also known as the Bloody Baron. Despite his violent moniker, this man treated Ciri with kindness and respect.''
:''It seemed that during Ciri's time in Velen she got into a quarrel with some sort of witch or witches in the swamps.''
:''Geralt learned the truth of Ciri's time in the swamps from the mouths of the hideous Crones themselves. Even Ciri, better able to hold her own than most anyone in existence, was lucky to escape from these powerful beings alive and intact.''
:''The visions revealed by the Mask of Uroboros made it clear beyond all doubt: Ciri had played a role in the magic catastrophe on Ard Skellig. More importantly, they confirmed she had been in Skellige - and then fled in the face of grave danger.''
:''Ultimate, tangible proof of the truth that the emperor had spoken the truth about Ciri's pursuers came in the form of a corpse – one belonging to a warrior of the Wild Hunt. The Riders truly were on Ciri's trail.''
:''In hindsight, putting Ciri in touch with Whoreson was not one of my brightest ideas. In my defense, I can only say that her situation was so perilous even the riskiest plan seemed better than inactivity.''
:''After many adventures and mishaps, Geralt finally found Ciri on the Isle of Mists. When he crossed the threshold into the room in which she slumbered, the protective spell Avallac'h had cast upon her snapped under the sheer weight of their combined destinies. Geralt was reunited with his adopted daughter after years of separation and searching. No words can describe the joy he felt in that moment.''
:''Avallac'h's prediction that the Wild Hunt would descend on Kaer Morhen as soon as Ciri arrived was proven true. All present spared no effort in defending her. In the end, though, it was she who defended them – through an outburst of unbridled power, the raw strength of her Elder Blood, she saved the protectors of Kaer Morhen from certain death.''
:''Though it was Cirilla who convinced Geralt to go with her to exact vengeance on Imlerith, it was the witcher who stood against Vesemir's killer in a final duel. Ciri slayed some evil that day, however, killing two of the three monsterous sisters who had usurped for themselves rule over Velen.''
:''Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that...''
:'''If Geralt does not take Ciri to Vizima:'''
::''...It was thus no surprise that Ciri did not even want to see him.''
:'''If Geralt does take Ciri to Vizima:'''
::...''Standing face to face with him was surely one of the most difficult challenges she had ever undergone.''
::'''If Geralt refuses the reward'''
:::''Ciri emerged from this trial victorious, and with an enhanced awareness of how deeply and unconditionally Geralt, her adopted father, loved and cared for her.''
:''Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears I can conclude that she let the mistresses of magic know...''
::'''If Geralt accompanied Ciri to the Lodge meeting:'''
:::...''that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.''
::'''If Geralt does not accompany Ciri to the Lodge meeting:'''
:::...''in clear terms that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands.''
:''A visit to Avallac'h's secret laboratory revealed facts that shook Ciri to her core. Though she had long known she was the last of Lara Dorren's line, the only remaining heir to the so-called Elder Blood, only now did she realize this line had been an object of unbroken interest to elven Sages and human mages for two centuries. Another blow came from the words of the arrogant she-elf, which rankled in her heart like a thorny bramble.''
:'''If Ciri wrecks Avallac'h's lab:'''
::''Though unleashing anger on inanimate objects might not be considered mature behaviour, it definitely helps bring one relief. Ciri thus reached for this most simple of solutions.''
:''Eredin had perished - but the evil king's death only ever heralds the end in fairy tales. In our story, this meant it was time for Ciri to face her destiny. Only she possessed the power to stop the White Frost - the near mythical force which threatened not just our world, but countless others as well.''

{{Ciri Family Tree}}

==Notes==
*According to ''Blood of Elves'', her name is derived from the [[Elder Speech]] word ''Zireael'', Swallow.
*Sometime by the late 14th century, no surviving portraits of her exist anymore. Ironically, the one that people believe is of her in Cintra is actually that of her [[False Ciri|double]].
*In the optional quest in the third game where Ciri meets Emhyr var Emreis, he announces her as ''"Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra, Princess of Brugge, and Duchess of Sodden. Heiress to Inis Ard Skellig and Inis An Skellig, and suzeraine of Attre and Abb Yarra."''
**In the ''Time of Contempt'' novel a [[False Ciri|girl]] officially claimed to be Ciri by the Nilfgaardian Empire is declared to hold the last title; however Emhyr var Emreis knows she's not the real heir to the Cintran throne but plays along until they can find the real Ciri.
*In {{Tw1}}, the innkeeper at the [[Country Inn]] in the village of [[Murky Waters]] can tell Geralt the tale of "Cirilla".
*In {{Tw2}}, she's mentioned a couple times (both indirectly and directly by name).
*In {{Tw3}}, she appears on [[Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (gwent card)|one of the cards]] in [[Gwent neutral cards|neutral deck]].
*She appears in ''[[The Hexer (TV series)|The Hexer]]'' TV series in 4 episodes ("[[Świątynia Melitele (episode)|Świątynia Melitele]]", "[[Mniejsze zło (episode)|Mniejsze zło]]", "[[Falwick (episode)|Falwick]]", and "[[Ciri (episode)|Ciri]]"). Unlike in the books, she first met Geralt at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. She is also not depicted during her teenage years in the series.

=== Ciri's age ===
* Andrzej Sapkowski appears to contradict himself on Ciri's exact age as the following:
** In {{BoE}}, Ciri states she's 13 in spring of {{Year|canon=yes|year=1266}} (which is backed by {{ToC}} when she says she's 14 in {{Year|canon=yes|year=1267}}).
** In {{TTotS}} and {{TLotL}}, some characters guess she's 15 to 16 years old, which would put her as born in {{Year|canon=yes|year=1251}} or {{Year|canon=yes|year=1252}} instead. However, Ciri neither confirms nor corrects these statements.
** Near the end of {{TLotL}}, the author once more contradicts this information when, in March {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1268}}, Emhyr remarks it's been 16 years since he and Geralt last saw each other, meaning {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1252}}. If [[Nenneke]] was right in guessing Ciri was born around [[Belleteyn]], this would mean Ciri can't be any older than 14 years and 10 months when the [[assault on Stygga castle]] happened. It's unclear though if Emhyr just did a basic rounding with years (1268-1252=16) or if he rounded down and meant 17 years instead.
** In the [[Dynastic descriptions]], she's described as being 12 when she and [[Hjalmar an Craite|Hjalmar]] got "engaged". However, this would have been impossible due to fact that the [[Slaughter of Cintra]] took place in {{Year|canon=yes|year=1263}} and she went to Kaer Morhen in {{Year|canon=yes|year=1264}}. Even if she was born in {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1252}}, this would have still been impossible as she'd only have been 11 at most when the Slaughter of Cintra took place, still putting her below 12 years old.
