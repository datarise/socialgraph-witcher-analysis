'''Raven''' is a legendary [[witcher]] mentioned in {{Tw1}}. In particular, he was known to have possessed a [[Raven's armor|splendid armour]] which was forged in the [[gnome]]s' workshops beneath [[Mount Carbon]], and finished by [[elf|elves]]. This armour was buried with him.

He is first mentioned by [[Berengar]].

Inscription on his tomb states:
: ''Here lies the witcher known as Raven - a great warrior and defender of the weak. Honored be his name.''

Since Raven's tomb cover is broken, one can see that he is actually buried with two witcher's swords.
