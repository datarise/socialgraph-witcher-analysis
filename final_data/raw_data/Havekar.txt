The elves called them hav'caaren, an untranslatable word, but one which was associated with rapacious greed.|citation = {{BoF}} (UK edition)}}The '''Havekar''' ([[Elder Speech]]: ''hav'caaren''), also known as '''hawkers''', are opportunistic smugglers who sell arms and supplies to the [[Scoia'tael]] at high prices, lining their own pockets on the misfortune of others. They have been known to renege on deals and sell out their own "clients" for the right price or incentive, often taking advantage of the worsening relations between the [[elf|elves]] and the [[human]]s to make profit.

Havekar are looked upon with contempt by both humans and elves. They tended to be primarily human, but their membership does include some assimilated elves and [[dwarf|dwarves]]. They appear in {{BoF}}, the third novel in the {{BoE}} saga.

The '''hav'caaren''' are also known as "hawkers", so conversations about "hawkers and squirrels" abound in {{Tw1}}. [[Siegfried of Denesle|Siegfried]] says that their name derives from an [[Elf|elven]] word for "ravenous greed", although his grasp of the elven tongue may be sub-optimal, his observation is nonetheless quite accurate.

{{Block Quote|text = It is difficult to say who held more contempt for the hawkers: humans, whose laws they broke by trading with Scoia'tael, or the elven warriors themselves, who viewed them as honorless race traitors. Whatever the case, the hawkers paid neither any mind. If coin was to be had, they'd bargain with anyone.|citation = [[A Canceled Transaction]]}}
