The '''blacksmith's wife''' is the only member of the [[Murky Waters]] family who is not a merchant. Running the household and dealing with a [[Blacksmith's son|moody teenager]] is plenty to keep her busy, or so it would seem. She does, however, have the time to muse about her [[Murky Waters blacksmith|husband]]'s activities when he is not at home or working.

She is very friendly and apparently a very good cook. She gives [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] the [[Temptation]] quest. Her husband is carrying on with a succubus and she would like an end to it. She offers a [[Plants of Barren Lands|book of herbal lore]] as the reward, but as Geralt leaves her hut, he is immediately intercepted by her husband, who knows what she is up to. He makes Geralt a counter-offer. Decisions, decisions...
