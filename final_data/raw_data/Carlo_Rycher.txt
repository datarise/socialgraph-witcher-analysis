'''Carlo Rycher''' was a merchant who operated near the docks of [[Novigrad]]. He was a medium class trader who lived in one of the villages near the city, but traded in the metropolis. When he was questioned by the [[Temple Guard]] if he had any [[mage]] or [[herbalist]] in the family, he responded that his father was a mere stove-fitter and his mother stayed at home.

When they asked about [[Elf|elven]] and/or other [[nonhuman]]s blood in him he stated that they only crossed [[horse]]s and asses in the village and that they took care about inhabits blood staying pure.
