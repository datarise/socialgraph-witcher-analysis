'''Lothar''' lived in the village of [[Rannvaig]] in [[Skellige]] with his son and wife in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

== Biography ==
Sometime prior to 1272, Lothar had been in a 10 year relationship with [[Jonna]], but for unknown reasons he left her one day and married another woman and the two had a son, [[Tjalve]]. However, his scorned lover didn't forget this and planted a nithing outside his hut, cursing his son to the point he'd die soon if it wasn't lifted.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt investigates}} Geralt asked Jonna to lift the curse, who agreed but for a steep price: she wanted Lothar to denounce his family and return to her, which would strip his family of honor and condemn them to poverty. On learning this, Lothar all but demanded Geralt carve Jonna's name instead on the nithing, which would reverse the curse on the caster.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt gets Lothar to agree}} Lothar reluctantly returned to Jonna but when she tried to convince him that he'd soon forget about his son and that she'd bear him healthy sons, he told her point blank he agreed only to return to her, not to love her.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt decides to carve her name}} Lothar was thankful for the witcher saving his family and invited him to stay for dinner but Geralt decided to head out.
