'''Azar Javed''' was a [[Zerrikania]]n [[alchemist]] and renegade [[mage|sorcerer]] drawing Power from [[fire]]. Expelled from [[Ban Ard Academy]], Javed went on to become an influential underworld figure leading the infamous [[Salamandra]] and its clandestine operations within the [[Northern Kingdoms]].

After secretly allying with [[Grandmaster]] [[Jacques de Aldersberg]], Javed ordered the storming of [[Kaer Morhen]] and stole the [[witcher]] [[mutagen]]s. Having acquired them, he proceeded to create [[mutant]] soldiers for his benefactor. In the end, the Zerrikanian mage died in his second fight against [[Geralt of Rivia]].

==Biography==
===Rogue mage===
Born in the lands of [[Zerrikania]], Javed set off for the [[Northern Kingdoms]] at a young age to enter the prestigious Ban Ard Academy in [[Kaedwen]]. He used the services of the [[Vivaldi Bank]] to pay tuition. In [[Ban Ard]], Javed strove to master the elemental powers of [[fire]]. Nevertheless he didn't finish the academy, his masters expelling him for an appalling interest in [[forbidden art|dark magic]]. This left the Zerrikanian as a renegade in foreign realms, though by this point he was already a formidable force.

In time, he would come to be the boss of his own [[gang|criminal organization]] known as the [[Salamandra]]. The gang grew increasingly powerful in the underworld and Javed took in mage-rejects such as [[Savolla]] to continue their training.<ref name="w1">{{Tw1}}</ref> Eventually, the Salamandra reached an understanding with [[Novigrad]]'s [[Syndicate]] too.<ref name="cg">{{Gwent standalone}}</ref>

===The Grand Plan===
====Stealing witcher secrets====
[[File:Tw-screenshot-javed.png|thumb|250px|Scouring through the Wolf School laboratory, the Salamandra boss found what he was looking for.|alt=]]
Ambitious to a fault, Javed was at one point contacted by the founding Grand Master of the [[Order of the Flaming Rose]], [[Jacques de Aldersberg]], who revealed to him his "Grand Plan" to take over the North. First of, they needed an [[mutant|invincible warriors]]. Fortunately for Javed and de Aldersberg, [[Berengar]], at the time fed up with his life as a monster slayer, uncovered the potential of [[witcher]] mutagens and formulas to them. Berengar also told Salamandra of a secret path that led to [[Kaer Morhen]].<ref name="w1"/>

Not hesitating, the Zerrikanian mustered his forces, promising 50 [[oren]] reward to anyone who would manage to kill a witcher.<ref>{{Tw3}}</ref> One day shortly before [[Belleteyn]] of 1270, Javed ordered the assault. The Salamandra boss let Savolla and his [[frightener]] lead the charge, wasting no time and going straight for the [[witchers' laboratory]] alongside his second-in-command, the [[Professor]]. [[Triss Merigold]] attempted to stop them, but severely underestimated Javed who knocked her out and proceeded unharmed.

Upon entering the spacious underground, Javed found a [[Circle of Elements]] from which he drew power. Thus strengthened, he created an [[obstruction|impenetrable barrier]] between the laboratory and the rest of the undergrounds to keep anyone from interrupting his search for [[Secrets stolen from Kaer Morhen|witchers' secrets]]. Two of the [[School of the Wolf]] witchers, [[Geralt of Rivia]] and [[Leo]], caught up with Javed and the Professor. Javed, having found what he came for, [[teleportation|teleported]] away and left the [[portal]] open long enough for the Professor to follow.<ref name="w1"/>

====Operating from Vizima====
After returning to [[Vizima]], Javed used his extensive knowledge of mutation and alchemy to begin experiments, setting up [[Javed's laboratory|his laboratory]] in the [[Old manor catacombs|catacombs]] beneath the [[Old Manor]]. His ultimate goal was to create warriors who would posses extraordinary strength, endurance, agility and regeneration while at the same time being unquestioningly obedient to the Order of the Flaming Rose. When the Professor ended up in the [[Vizima dungeon|dungeon]], Javed had him bailed out. Later, Azar noticed that Geralt started working with detective [[Raymond Maarloeve]] which he already had history with, so he sent some assassins to scare Raymond and get him to hide for a while, sometime after that he killed the detective and used powerful [[illusion]] to assume Raymond's identity.
[[File:Cutscene Azar Prof 3.png|thumb|250px|Javed underestimated the White Wolf in the swamps near Vizima.]]
Disguised, he persuaded Geralt to go into the [[swamp]] outside the city and find a way to open the [[mage's tower]] there. When he had the witcher away, Javed tried to either get [[Kalkstein]] and [[Ramsmeat]] on Salamandra's side or remove any obstacle they could pose to his plans. Ramsmeat, however, survived the attackers Javed sent to slice his throat. During the briefings false Raymond had with Geralt, the Salamandra boss didn't much bother with keeping his disguise as Maarloeve outside the superficial appearance. Not only did he ask for payment, he kept a box of [[fisstech]] in his room, both of which the detective wouldn't. Satisfied with information gathered via investigation, Javed gave the witcher the last [[Sephirot]] needed to open the tower before they went to visit it.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt figured out the ruse}} After Geralt exited the tower, Javed, still disguised as the detective, moved in for a surprise attack but Geralt revealed he knew the real Raymond had been killed and was therefore talking to Javed.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt didn't figure out the ruse}} After Geralt exited the tower, Javed attacked, revealing to the witcher he had killed the detective earlier and taken his place.

The two then start to fight but since it was in the swamps where the damp environment weakened his fire powers, Javed called on the Professor for help and summoned two [[genie]]s of fire, [[ifrit]]s. They then jointly fought the witcher until the Professor managed to poison Geralt with [[manticore]] venom. After that, the mage and the assassin teleported away.

Much to Javed's chagrin, Triss Marigold nursed Geralt back to health and the witcher returned to his goal, destroying the [[Salamandra hideout in the sewers]]. Meanwhile, the Zerrikanian used the absence of King Foltest to seal a deal with ambitious [[Adda the White]]. Through her, Salamandra passed fake edicts in exchange for promise of assistance should the princess decide to dethrone her father. Javed tried to convince [[Radovid V]] of [[Redania]] to join the conspiracy as well, finance Salamandra, but that failed.

When Geralt located the underground [[Salamandra base]], Javed came face to face with him again. Saying that last time he underestimated the witcher he ordered the Professor to deal with it and fled once more. Afterwards he returned to his work on mutations to provide the Grand Master with the army requested.<ref name="w1"/>

====Last fight====
[[File:Cutscene spared Berengar 2.png|thumb|250px|The sorcerer chose to not flee again and fight the witcher for third and a last time.|alt=]]
Javed ultimately took to hiding out at the main hide out at the [[Old Manor]] but the witcher soon tracked him down. Using [[mutant assassin]]s and mutated [[Rayla]] to get rid of Geralt, Javed himself mostly waited down in his laboratory. When Geralt slashed through that first obstacle, Javed sicced his [[koshchey]] on the witcher.

That too, however, didn't stop the proficient [[monster]] slayer and so Javed finally sent in several massive [[greater brother]]s. Ultimately, though, Geralt got to him and the final confrontation ensued, leading to Azar Javed's death.<ref name="w1"/>

===Legacy===
The word of Salamandra's fall and Javed's demise got around during the year that followed.<ref>{{TWotW}}</ref> Two remnants of his criminal guild, led by [[Dmitri]] and [[Vencel Pugg]], operating far from the center of events in [[Flotsam]], kept on for some time but had little to no significance.<ref>{{Tw2}}</ref>

==Personality and appearance==
[[File:People Azar Javed.png|thumb|220px|The Zerrikanian was proud of his creations.]]
{{Quote|text=Salamandra is not evil. Not more than those with the will to shape their own fate!<br>If Salamandra is not evil incarnate, then what of Javed? Amorality, rape, murder, treason... What would you call this creature?<br>The future. Evolution or destiny...|citation=Javed conveying his philosophy to Geralt, {{Tw1}}}}
Azar Javed was a bald, swarthy Zerrikanian with a black beard and sinister gaze. He adorned his body with complex piercings and leather strap accessories, especially face and neck, as was the custom in his native land.<ref>''[[The Witcher Artbook]]''</ref> His look was completed by a leather jerkin full of chains and [[amulet]]s hanging around and a pair of pointed shoes.

As a person, Javed was a thoroughly ruthless man with a peculiar sense of morality who considered murder, rape, treason, and extortion all as means to an end. He liked to enjoy pleasures life had to offer, and so he let his lust go unchecked and took large doses of purest fisstech. Ramsmeat described him as a wild man.<ref name="w1"/> Furthermore, the Zerrikanian's connection with fire run so deep some said it had become a part of his very being.<ref name="cg"/> True or not, Javed did have a pyromaniac fetish that scared the Viziman [[prostitute]]s. When it came to politics, Javed detested Foltest for the rampage caused by the [[striga]] in the past, as well as for the king's attempt at a truce with the [[Nilfgaardian Empire]] during the [[Second Northern War]], which the mage viewed as a betrayal of the North.<ref name="w1"/>

==Trivia==
*In Persian, ''Âzar Jâvêd'' means the "Eternal Fire". As ''The Witcher'''s lead story designer Artur Ganszyniec confirmed, this was deliberate and connects to the Zerrikanian's mastery of fire.<ref>[https://grynieznane.pl/2019/12/11/azar-javed-z-pierwszego-wiedzmina-ma-swietnie-dobrane-imie-i-nazwisko/ "Azar Javed z pierwszego wiedźmina ma świetnie dobrane imie i nazwisko" – Polish article]</ref>
*Originally, [[Rience]] was supposed to be the sorcerer-antagonist of ''The Witcher''. The developers even planned, at one point, to have Rience resurrected through cloning from his fingers that [[Ciri]] severed before he drowned. In subsequent versions of the script, the idea was abandoned in favor of creating the original character of Azar Javed.<ref>[https://www.slideshare.net/Polygamia/rozlege-fabuy-gameday2010 "Rozległe Fabuły Gameday 2010" – CDPR's presentation in Polish]</ref>
