'''Bruno''' was a man who wrote a [[Missing: Mikel|notice]] for the [[Notice board (Inn at the Crossroads)|notice board]] near the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] in the hopes that his missing brother [[Mikel]] would be found safe.

Unlike his brother though, he wasn't nearly as generous or selfless, having tried to talk Mikel out of helping the women in favor of keeping himself safe at home.
