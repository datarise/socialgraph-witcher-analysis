==Biography==
{{Condition|Text = If Geralt meets and follows the dog}} [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], having rescued the dog from a pack of [[Wolf (creature)|wolves]], noted the dog was rather friendly and had a [[Key (quest item)|key]] sewn into its collar. The dog then led Geralt to his former owner's hut and the [[witcher]] deduced what'd happened. However, when he went back outside to see Barylka, the dog was nowhere to be found.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't save the dog}} Unfortunately Barylka met their end when a pack of wolves attacked the dog, killing it.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps but doesn't follow}} Barylka tried to get the witcher to follow, but for whatever reason Geralt didn't. The dog was never seen again.
