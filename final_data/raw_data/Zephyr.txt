== Biography ==
According to a story told by the [[Naiad (Murky Waters lakeside)|Naiad]], Zephyr was one of [[Vizima]]'s most famous thieves before his death. Apparently, on his last escape attempt through the [[Vizima sewers|city sewers]], his loot proved too heavy and his greed go great for him to survive and he drowned trying to keep it all.

Somehow, he ended up becoming a drowned dead – otherwise common post-[[Conjunction of the Spheres|Conjunction]] monster and not a cursed form but the poetic Naiad might as well have made the story up – and became the leader of the lakeside [[drowner]]s near Murky Waters.

His theft of the [[Naiad's necklace|Naiad's turquoise necklace]] was behind the [[Naiad]]'s request when [[Geralt of Rivia]] first met her in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1270}}.
