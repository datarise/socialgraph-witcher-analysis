'''Sverre''' was a [[Clan Heymaey]] warrior who cobbled a crew together to try to deal with the [[Contract: Monster on the High Road|beast on the High Road]]. However, they were unprepared for such a beast that could lay ambushes and only 4 of the men survived the attack, including Sverre. Despite this, the survivors were set on trying to go back for their fallen comrades to at least give them a proper burial.
