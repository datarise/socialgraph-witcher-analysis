The '''merchant''' is a [[gwent]] player, but doesn't sell any gwent cards. Although he claims to sell milk, he does not have any in his stock.

Instead, he sells [[Water (item)|water]], [[bread]], and alcoholic beverages that can be used in alchemy such as: [[Temerian rye]], [[Mandrake cordial]], [[Cherry cordial]], and [[Nilfgaardian lemon]]. The random gwent card can be won from him.

The merchant disappears from the village and his services become unavailable if [[the Ghost in the Tree]] is freed or killed during the quest [[The Whispering Hillock]].
==Notes==
*He boasts a particularly pathetic [[Monsters Gwent deck]] where nearly all of his Muster cards are impaired, except for the [[Nekker (gwent card)|Nekker]] which he has 2 instead of 3. Which makes him an easy source of income at the beginning of the game.
