An unnamed '''Prison Warden''' was a high-ranking official of the [[witch hunter]]s who presided over [[Deireadh prison]] and commanded its garrison until {{year|canon=no|year=1272}}. During his infiltration of the prison, [[Geralt of Rivia]] killed the warden in order to obtain the cell key, which would be used to free [[Margarita Laux-Antille]].

== Combat Tactics ==
The warden emerges from his quarters after most of the witch hunters and [[Royal Redanian Army|Redanian soldiers]] guarding the courtyard of the prison have been killed. He wields a two-handed sword in combat. After being hit once, he parries the second strike and stuns Geralt.

==Notes==
*Upon death, the warden drops one pair of [[dimeritium shackles]], a [[witch hunter's sword]], and the [[cell key]].

== Associated Quest ==
* [[The Great Escape]]
