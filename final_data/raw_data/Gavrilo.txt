'''Gavrilo''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He can be found in the [[Kaedweni camp]] during Chapter II.

Upon meeting Gavrilo, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] will recognize him, leading to Gavrilo's confession about having worked for [[Salamandra]] and being spared by Geralt. Gavrilo hopes Geralt to bear no grudge and will offer a "trinket" (Robust Well-Balanced Silver Dagger) as compensation.
