'''Marquise Serenity''' was the madame at the [[Passiflora]] in [[Novigrad]]. She was also a [[gwent]] player, with [[Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck|Nilfgaard]] being her choice of deck, and will reward the [[Morvran Voorhis (gwent card)|Morvran Voorhis]] card if beaten.

==Biography==
Marquise Serenity worked at the Passiflora for many years, persevering with her job even after most of her friends had left to pursue other ventures. She recounted once meeting [[Geralt of Rivia]] and [[Dandelion]] when they arrived at the brothel with two [[halfling]]s.

In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, she had provided room and board at the Passiflora to [[Sigismund Dijkstra]] and his associates as they were plotting to assassinate King [[Radovid V]]. The madame settled Dijkstra on the top floor in one of the brothel's best suites, which was up a staircase hidden behind a secret door.

==Notes==
* Certain dialogue options reveal that she is one of the few women in the Witcher's World to have served in an official capacity in a nation's military, with another example being [[Ves]].
