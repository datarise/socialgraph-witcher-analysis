'''Helma''' lived in the [[Farcorners]] district of [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, in a hut just on the edges of the fields around the area. She had been previously married to a man named Ignatius, but after he died she lived by herself, not wishing to remarry despite others pestering her about it.

At one point Luzi, a young woman in the area, was arranged to be married off by her parents to a far older man. Not wishing to go through with it, Luzi committed suicide on her wedding day with a [[silver dagger]] and her parents, refusing to sell it off or bury it, entrusted it to Helma instead.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps her}} After learning [[The White Lady]] was a [[noonwraith]], Helma deduced it was Luzi, and revealed what happened to the young woman to the [[witcher]]. She then gave [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] the dagger to use to draw out the noonwraith and finally lay Luzi's spirit to rest.
