'''Tobias Hoffman''' was the mayor and chief of the village of [[Murky Waters]]. He had two daughters, [[Alina]], the bride to be, and [[Celina]], her jealous older sister. He considered [[Adam (Murky Waters)|Adam]], whom he knew to be infatuated with his daughter, to be a fool.

He had a fairly peculiar manner of speaking and seemed to like choosing nicknames for people. He continually referred to [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] as "Beastie baiter". His other hobbies included [[The Witcher dice poker|dice poker]], in which he was a professional level player.

During the day, he can be found at his house, or rather one of his houses, if the [[Country Inn|innkeeper]] is to be believed. He is usually inside, but occasionally goes outside for a breath of fresh air. When asked about witcher work, he mentions that he will pay for the heads of [[Teyu]] and [[Ureus]], monsters currently plaguing the peaceful surroundings.
