'''Donar an Hindar''' of [[Clan Heymaey]] was a jarl of [[Hindarsfjall]] in [[Skellige]].

== Journal Entry ==
:''Few jarls of Skellige were as honored and obeyed as Donar an Hindar, the eldest of their number. Despite his advanced age he remained the active leader of his clan and its representative at all official gatherings. The only person able to break his composure was [[Madman Lugos]], [[Clan Drummond|whose clan]] had long feuded with the an Hindars.''
:''Donar's home was, like [[Freya]]'s temple, on Hindarsfjall. As befits a neighbor to the gods, Donar was famed for his wise, considered opinions and his piety. This last did not, however, extend to the gods of the [[Continent]], whose rich sanctuaries he had often raided in his youth.''
