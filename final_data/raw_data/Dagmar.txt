'''Dagmar''' was a peasant from [[Claywich]], [[Velen]] around {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272
|Type = game}}. Like many others from his village, he worshiped the [[Allgod]], as did his forefathers, not realizing it was no [[Religion|deity]] at all but a [[sylvan]].

When the [[Third Nilfgaard War]] hit, the area fell on lean times and with nothing left to offer the Allgod but scraps not even fit for feeding to their [[dog]]s. The Allgod, incensed by these meager offerings, threatened to curse them if they didn't offer better.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt bargains with the Allgod}} Thankful to the [[witcher]], Dagmar and the rest continued to worship the Allgod, albeit with smaller offerings while the war continued.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't bargain}} Sadly accepting they had no other recourse, Dagmar proceeded to offer what little food he had left in storage.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt kills the Allgod}} Distraught, Dagmar and [[Preben]] proclaimed the Allgod said worse things would happen to them if he ever died and the two ran home to do a group prayer in hopes it'd save them.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt reveals the cellar}} Dagmar and Preben eyed the now exposed cellar with curiosity and some time later, the cellar was covered up with no worshipers showing up at the shrine.
