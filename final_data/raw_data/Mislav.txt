'''Mislav''' was a [[hunter]] who lived in a small hut near [[White Orchard]].

== Biography ==
When he was younger, he served as the [[Ignatius Verrieres|local lord]]'s hunter in his [[Amavet Fortress Ruins|employer's manor]] until [[Dieter]], another servant, discovered the homosexual relationship between Mislav and [[Florian Verrieres|Florian]], the lord's son. Dieter outed them and Mislav was exiled from the manor and became an outcast.

When [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] came to White Orchard in the May of {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he was contracted by [[Captain]] [[Peter Saar Gwynleve]] to kill the [[Griffin (creature)|griffin]] that was prowling the area, and he would provide Geralt with information about the location of [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]]. After Geralt agreed, he was given two names, [[Tomira]], the local herbalist and Mislav, the local hunter.

Geralt found Mislav in the woods, hunting a pack of [[Dog|wild dogs]], in which he got assistance from Geralt. Mislav then showed him the camp where the griffin attacked a group of [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian soldiers]]. Geralt thanked Mislav, and continued on his hunt.

==Notes==
*If Geralt finds the griffin's nest on his own, Mislav can still be found outside his hut, but it would not be possible to start a conversation with him.
