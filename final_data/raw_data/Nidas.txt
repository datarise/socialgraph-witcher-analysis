'''Nidas''' was a former [[Temeria]]n soldier that, in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, was visiting [[Novigrad]] in the hopes of finding someone to help him out with a personal matter.

== Biography ==
In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1242}}, he was enlisted in the infantry. Later he met his wife Letta and a joke started up between them about how he'd bring home a black pearl for her from one of his many battles, though this never transpired. The two married anyways but by 1272 his wife became sick, suffering from the equivalent of Alzheimer's in that she couldn't remember or recognize people. In an attempt to help her ailing mind, Nidas decided to set out and bring back a [[black pearl (quest item)|black pearl]] for her in hopes it'd somehow help her remember things.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps him out}} on seeing Geralt, Nidas got the witcher to help him acquire a black pearl from [[Skellige]] for his wife. Sadly, Letta didn't appear any different on seeing the pearl, though he was still grateful for Geralt's assistance in the matter.
