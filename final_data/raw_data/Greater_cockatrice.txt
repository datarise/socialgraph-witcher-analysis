[[File:Trophy_Cockatrice.png|thumb]]The '''greater cockatrice''' is better known as the "beast of the sewers". It is larger than regular [[cockatrice]]s and threatens the [[Temple Quarter]] should it escape the [[Vizima sewers|sewers]]. Even the [[Order of the Flaming Rose]] has taken an interest, as has the [[City Guard]].

[[Vincent Meis]] offers to pay for the creature's [[The Witcher trophy quests|head]], but should you miss your rendezvous with Vincent in Chapter II, the [[Royal huntsman]] will also provide a reward for the head in Chapter III.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[The Beast of the Sewers]]

== Notes ==
* This is the only trophy quest which is not optional.
* The remains of the creature contain one of the [[sephirot]] necessary to complete Chapter II.[[Category:The Witcher characters]]
