'''Agneta''' was a [[Temeria]]n woman from [[Midcopse]].

==Biography==
Not much is known about Agneta's life, except she was a widow, having outlived three of her previous husbands. At one point she witnessed [[Jenny o' the Woods]], a powerful [[nightwraith]], in the fields near the village.

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt took on the nightwraith contract}} 
In {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, she was approached by [[Geralt of Rivia]] for information about the wraith, which the [[witcher]] intended to hunt down for a contract. Agneta did not see the wraith too clearly as she had run away almost immediately to tell the other villagers about it, however, she did give Geralt one important clue that "Jenny" appeared just after twilight.
