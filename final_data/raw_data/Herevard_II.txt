'''Herevard II '''(Polish: ''Hereward II'') is the successor of [[Hereward]] as [[Prince]] of [[Ellander]]. He was always considered the rightful heir and as such also obtained a proper education.<ref>[https://twitter.com/MTomaszkiewicz/status/808749143195844609 Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz: "Yes, he was the rightful heir."]</ref> When Nilfgaardians conquered [[Vizima]], he decided to not object to his new ruler and "fell in line with the new order."<ref>[https://twitter.com/MTomaszkiewicz/status/808766856999931904 Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz: "He fell in line with the new order."]</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The name "Hereward" is derived from the Old English elements ''here'' "army" and ''weard'' "guard". This was the name of an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon leader who rebelled against Norman rule.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/hereward Behind the Names: Hereward]</ref> The ''v'' instead of ''w'' in English translation is for better pronunciation.
