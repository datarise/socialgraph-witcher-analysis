He is having a great deal of difficulty repairing the bridge. He and his son, [[Pat]], work on it all day, every day, but each night the Griggs undo all their hard work. What to do?

He says that he has been having dreams in which ghosts who haunt the bridge have asked him to rebuild it. Since it has fallen into disrepair, they can not rest.
