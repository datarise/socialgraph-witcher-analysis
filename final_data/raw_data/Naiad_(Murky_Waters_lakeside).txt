}}This '''naiad''' which lived on the eastern shore of the [[Lakeside]] near [[Murky Waters]] was a loyal servant of the [[Lady of the Lake (nymph)|Lady of the Lake]] skilled in [[healing]].

== Biography ==
In summer {{Year|canon=no|year=1270}}, a host of [[drowner]]s under the leadership of [[Zephyr]], a particularly nasty [[drowned dead]], began to harass her and even went so far as stealing a [[Naiad's necklace|turquoise necklace]] which was gifted to her from the Lady.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt kills Zephyr}} Eventually her woes were solved by witcher Geralt of Rivia who killed both Zephyr and his minions. For services rendered, the naiad offered him three possible rewards: an [[earth rune]], a book about [[vodyanoy]] named ''[[A Description of the Vodyanoi or the Fishpeople]]'', or the status of her lifelong patient.
