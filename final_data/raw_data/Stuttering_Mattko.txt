'''Stuttering Mattko''' was a [[horse]] racer outside [[Crow's Perch]] and, by his appearance, a mercenary.

No matter what order you race him, he'll always give a [[racing saddle]] and 20 {{Crown}} when beaten. He also appears to be the easiest to beat at Crow's Perch as he never has obstacles appear when racing him.
