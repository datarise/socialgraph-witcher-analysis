'''Merchants''' in {{Tw3}} can buy and sell: [[The Witcher 3 food and drink|food and drinks]], all [[:Category: The Witcher 3 ingredients|alchemical ingredients]] (except [[loot]] from [[The Witcher 3 bestiary|monsters]] such as [[The Witcher 3 mutagens|mutagens]] and [[:Category:The Witcher 3 trophies|trophies]]), and junk items.

Other (junk) items can be sold to merchants at higher prices compared to other types of shopkeepers, except [[:Category:The Witcher 3 keys|keys]] and [[Currency|currencies]]. Most merchants have preferred items and will offer higher prices for them, such as blacksmiths preferring weapons, armor, and runestones. Merchants of the same type have a few set tiers for purchasing your gear, ranging from offering 20% to ~41.5% of an item's face value. Generally, but not always, merchants in villages on the continent offer the least, those in large cities (those you cannot gallop within) offer the most, and Skellige merchants typically offer 35% of the item's face value.

Waiting or meditating for 5 whole days will refresh a merchant's cash supply.
