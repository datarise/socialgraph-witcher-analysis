'''Roderick of Daevon''' is a minor character and a Elite Kaedweni Knight featured in {{Tw2}} during the Chapter II. He can be found in the tent near main gate to [[Kaedweni camp]]. He is likely from [[Daevon]] and belongs to [[Henselt]]'s trusted knights, meaning he knows that king can be very touchy when it comes to his safety.

== Trivia ==
* He does not believe that [[Elf|elves]] and [[human]]s can live in peace and also thinks that legend around [[Saskia]] is just propaganda of [[Aedirn]].
