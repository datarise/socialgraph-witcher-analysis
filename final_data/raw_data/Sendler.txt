'''Sendler''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He is a [[The Witcher 2 merchants|merchant]], [[craftsman]], and [[The Witcher 2 dice poker|dice poker player]] who can be found in a building with fish hanging outside, southwest of [[Anezka]]'s house in [[Lobinden]].

== Journal Entry ==
: ''In [[Lobinden]] tanning and leather-working was the trade of Sendler, a skilful and reliable artisan. He ran a small stall with goods of his own making, but also accepted commissions for specific products. In these hard times, he made ends meet by working hard with his own hands.''

== Associated Quests ==
* [[Poker Face: Flotsam]]
* [[Troll Trouble]]

==Notes==
* The first time (and only the first) that Geralt defeats Sendler at dice poker, he may take one of three [[trap]] diagrams as a prize instead of the orens in the pot.
* A [[stuffed troll head]] hangs on the wall of Sendler's hut. It can be useful if the witcher seeks ingredients for a certain [[Melitele's Heart|ritual]] (for the tongue has not been removed), or if he wishes to provide the nearby [[Troll of Flotsam|bridge troll]] with some [[Troll Trouble|closure]]. Unfortunately, Sendler will neither give it away nor sell it outright - he must be [[Poker Face: Flotsam|defeated]] (a second time!) at dice poker.
