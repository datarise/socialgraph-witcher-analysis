'''Halfar''' was the leader of the bandits hired by [[Franz Kniprode]] and who the [[witcher]] later met. He was also feared in the underworld of [[Vizima]]. He appeared only in the 2004 video of {{Tw1}} and not in final cut although the model used is similar to the model later used for [[Boholt]] that was canceled also.
