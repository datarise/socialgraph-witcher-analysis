== Bestiary Entry ==
: ''Really wanna see an angry [[witcher]]?<br>Do you?<br>– Conversation overheard on the streets of [[Novigrad]]''
: ''The imp pestering the merchants of Novigrad turned out to be a doppler. These monsters usually avoid confrontation - to everyone's great relief, for when pinned they become extremely dangerous. Fighting them quickly turns into a fight against oneself. Or, to be precise, against a mirror image gifted with one's own strengths and abilities. In a conflict with such even odds, only luck - or destiny - decides the victor.''
: '''If Geralt kills him:'''
:: ''Geralt has an extra helping of both, and so won his fight against his doppler doppleganger - and, after a moment of hesitation, killed him. True, the monster had noble motives for his deeds, but that did not make him any less dangerous.''
: '''If Geralt lets him go:'''
:: ''Geralt has an extra helping of both, and so won his fight against his doppler doppleganger - then decided to let him go free, for unlike other monsters, this creature's motives for harming humans were noble.''
