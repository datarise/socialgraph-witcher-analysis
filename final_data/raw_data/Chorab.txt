'''Chorab''' was the village elder in [[Lobinden]].

== Journal Entry ==
:''Chorab was Lobinden's alderman. A simple man, he nevertheless blended his penchant for storytelling with a desire to teach and impart wisdom. His tales pertained to times long past, traditions worthy of preservation, and legends that had all but been forgotten. He cared for the community he led and represented, and any honest villager could count on his help.''
