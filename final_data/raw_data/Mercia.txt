'''Mercia''' was a [[prostitute]] in [[Crippled Kate's]] brothel in [[Novigrad]] during {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. Unlike some of her fellow coworkers, Mercia didn't much care for her job as a prostitute but believed others felt the same way about their jobs, like her man who cleaned fish for a living and couldn't get the stink out no matter what, and her mother who made pots for a living, leaving her hands extremely calloused.

== Trivia ==
* [[wikipedia:Mercia|Mercia]] was the name of one of the kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon's England.

== Notes ==
* Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either [[Triss Merigold]] or [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] and will not affect any of the romance endings [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can receive.
* For some reason, Mercia's character model (when naked) has the largest breasts out of all available prostitutes in the game.
