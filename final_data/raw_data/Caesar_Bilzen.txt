'''Caesar Bilzen''' was the accountant of [[Novigrad]] crime lord [[Carlo Varese|Cleaver]]. He resided in a [[Caesar Bilzen's house|spacious manor]] on [[Hierarch Square]]. A friend of [[Zoltan Chivay|Zoltan]]'s and an avid [[Gwent]] card collector, he was in possession of the unique "[[Fringilla Vigo (gwent card)|Fringilla Vigo]]" card.

In the [[dwarf]]'s house [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] discovers that he is actually a secret admirer of [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]], with a room filled with various Nilfgaardian memorabilia.
