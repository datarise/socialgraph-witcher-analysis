'''Nithral''' was an [[Aen Elle]] warrior and a member of the [[Wild Hunt]].

== Biography ==
After [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] and [[Keira Metz]] entered an old [[Elf|elven]] ruin in search for [[Ciri]], they found that the Wild Hunt had arrived there first. As the Wild Hunt had their [[Wild Hunt Navigator|navigator]], [[Caranthir Ar-Feiniel|Caranthir]], with them, they were able to travel through the ruins with ease, leaving Keira and Geralt to search the ruins for portals in order to get through. However, the riders were unable to find Ciri. Once Geralt and Keira arrived, they found that Caranthir and [[Eredin Bréacc Glas|Eredin]] were gone, with Nithral having stayed behind.

The two engaged in a battle with Nithral but the elven warrior was ultimately slain by Geralt, who continued to search the ruins with the [[Mage|sorceress]].
