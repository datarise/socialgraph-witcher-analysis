'''Thorleif''' was the village elder of [[Larvik]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, when an [[Hagubman|unknown beast]] started to ambush people on the main road, just outside the village. Immediately realizing this was no normal creature, he posted a notice, hoping someone skilled with a blade could handle it.
