Count '''Tybalt''' was a [[Order of the Flaming Rose|Knight of the Flaming Rose]]. If you chose [[Roche]]'s path, Geralt can find him sitting on the right side of the [[King]] [[Henselt]]'s tent at the [[Kaedweni camp]] during [[Chapters|Chapter II]].

If you sided with the Order in {{Tw1}} and imported a save into ''The Witcher 2'', he will reward you with a [[steel plate enhancement]] for your aid. If you killed [[Siegfried of Denesle]] in the original game, he attacks you.

== Trivia ==
* There is a bug where if you imported a neutral path saved game from ''The Witcher ''but did not kill Siegfried, Tybalt still attacks you saying you did kill Siegfried.
