'''Gascoigne''' was a [[bard]] traveling with a fellow bard, [[Victor]], along the road to [[Yantra]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} when the two had stopped to set up a small campfire and drink.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt partakes in drinking with them}} after [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] fell asleep, the two bards took all the [[witcher]]'s possessions and ran off to Yantra, intending to sell the items.

:{{Condition|Text = ...and demands their stuff}} already pissed off, Geralt caught up to them and not only demanded his stuff back but their stuff as well, leaving the bards clad only in their underwear.
:{{Condition|Text = ...and forgives them}} on catching up to them, Geralt decided to just demand back his stuff, which the bards readily handed over.
