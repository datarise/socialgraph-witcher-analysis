'''Uve Jabberjaw''' was the younger of [[Blueboy Lugos]]'s friends. He did not have a tongue, and therefore couldn't speak. If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] asked about his condition, Lugos says that Jabberjaw tore out his own tongue because he cursed the monarch [[Bran Tuirseach]] while drunk. He lost his power to speak... but kept his honour.
