}}'''Silgrat''' was the younger brother of [[Seltkirk]], the hero of the previous war with [[Kaedwen]]. Everyone in [[Vergen]] had heard of Seltkirk, but his brother was not nearly as famous. Living in the shadow of his great brother, Silgrat became embittered, hungry for acclaim. He thought defeating a [[witcher]] in a fistfight would bring him glory. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] picked up the gauntlet after winning several fistfights at [[The Cauldron]] in [[Vergen]].
