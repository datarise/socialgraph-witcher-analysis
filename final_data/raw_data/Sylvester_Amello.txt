At that time, he was troubled by a so-called "[[Imp]]" whom the merchant posted a contract on after it stole from his stall. Eventually, [[Geralt of Rivia]] responded to the notice, and Sylvester bade him to deal with the imp problem.

If Geralt brought him the Imp's head, Sylvester paid the witcher the agreed upon amount; otherwise, he only paid half.

*Though Sylvester is a merchant, it is not possible to trade with him. There is, however, a merchant in the same square whom it's possible to trade with.
