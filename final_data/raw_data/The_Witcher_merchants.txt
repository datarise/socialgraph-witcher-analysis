There are many '''merchants''' that Geralt encounters in his travels through Vizima and environs. Some are specialists, others are generalists and a few a just opportunists.

* Antiquaries, for [[Book prices|books and scrolls]].
* Blacksmiths and not just their helpers sell [[:Category:The Witcher weapons|weapons]] and [[Blade enhancement|related products]].
* Jewelers, for [[Jewelry]] as well as other [[:Category:Gifts|gifts]].
* Wait staff, otherwise known as ''[[waitresses]]'', in Inns sell [[The Witcher food and drink|food and drink]] and often grease, for [[The Witcher oils|blade coatings]].
* [[Druid]]s also tend to be merchants.

== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ==
This journal entry pertains only to one of two mutually exclusive encounters that Geralt has in the [[Trade Quarter]] with a [[noblewoman]].
:''"Vizima's [[Trade Quarter]] - rich townspeople with sophisticated tastes and knowledge of the newest fashions."''

The first is a woman in a [[:File:People Noblewoman 2.png|vermilion dress]] (over a white chemise, with purple trim on her headdress), found near the [[jester]] on [[John Natalis Square]]. She wants you to prove your manliness, either by presenting her with a [[kikimore claw]] or by offering her an insultingly low fee (0 works). The other option is a (possibly drunk) woman in [[:File:People_Noblewoman_3.png|white]], near the town hall, who uses a "missing" [[silk scarf]] to start a conversation with the witcher.
