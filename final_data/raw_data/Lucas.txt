'''Lucas''' was a [[nordling]] living around [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon=non|year=1272}} that, like many, didn't take kindly to [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardians]] waging war with them.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt attacks fights them}} Unfortunately, Kobe and Lucas tried to attack the witcher, leading to their deaths.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt gets them to leave}} Kobe and Lucas backed down and walked off. However, Rosa swore she'd remember their names and one day track them down if Nilfgaard won.
