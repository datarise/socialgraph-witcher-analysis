'''Boris''' was a [[rock troll]] living in [[Mudplough]], [[Velen]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. The area was also teeming with [[nekker]]s and so the troll put to good use one his favored recipes, nekker soup, which the [[ogroid]]s didn't take to very well and started to attack the rock troll in retaliation.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt intervenes}} deciding to help the outnumbered rock troll, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] killed off the attacking nekkers, for which Boris was grateful and gave the [[witcher]] a reward. After explaining he was cooking nekker soup, the witcher then told the troll to refrain from cooking any more of them to prevent future attacks.
