'''Boholt''' was the oldest member and also the leader of the [[Crinfrid Reavers]], a group of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] hired by [[King]] [[Niedamir]] to take part in the hunt for [[Myrgtabrakke]], a [[dragon]] outside [[Barefield]]. The two of his compatriots were [[Kennet]] and [[Gar]].<ref>{{SoD}}</ref>
== Biography ==
=== Early career ===
Together with his comrades he managed to slay three [[red dragon|red]] and one [[black dragon]] as well as wiped out all of the dracolizards and forktails in [[Redania]]. Their fame became so notorious that even [[Geralt of Rivia]] admired their skill.

=== The fateful hunt ===
{{For|For = the main article on this hunt|see = The Bounds of Reason}}

In {{Year|canon=yes|year=1254}} the Reavers were hired by [[Niedamir]] to help in hunting 
[[green dragon]] [[Myrgtabrakke]]. This turned harder than expected – Myrgtabrakke had a [[Saesenthessis|baby]] and was protected by [[golden dragon]] [[Villentretenmerth]] who injured Boholt's head during the fight.

=== Recovery and new recruits ===
By the time of {{Year|canon=no|year=1271}}, when Kennet and Gar met again with [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], they could tell him only a sad tale of what became of their leader after the dragon hunt. They said to him that Boholt lost his memory after taking a spill and hitting his head on a rock. While he could "still be a beast in battle", he did nought much else and even lost his interest in women.<ref>{{tw2}}</ref>

He eventually recovered some of his memories and started training new Reavers, including [[Jamor]] and [[Auwry]].<ref>{{tw3}} – {{BaW}}</ref>
