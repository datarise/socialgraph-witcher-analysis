'''Leif''' was the father of [[Kori]] and [[Kraki]] and part of [[Clan Drummond]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}. He was considered to be a troublemaker who detested visitors from the continent, a view he made sure to pass on to his sons.

{{Condition|Text = If Kori and Kraki are killed}} despite his sons being troublemakers themselves and having instigated the deadly fight that cost them their lives, Leif demanded that the lone survivor, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], be tried by their jarl, [[Madman Lugos]], for his sons' deaths.
