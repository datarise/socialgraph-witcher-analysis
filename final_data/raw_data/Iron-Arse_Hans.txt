'''Iron-Arse Hans''' was a [[horse]] racer outside [[Crow's Perch]] and, by his appearance, a mercenary. His horse was called Beecher.

No matter what order he's raced against, he will give [[saddlebags]] and 30 {{Crown}} when beaten. Sometimes when racing him an obstacle (loose barrels or a log) may appear.
