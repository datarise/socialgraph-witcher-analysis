'''Ronvid of the Small Marsh''' was a very inept yet persistent young [[knight]] intent on defeating 100 knights to prove his honor for Maid Bilberry in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272
|Type = game}}.

== Biography ==
To begin his mission, Ronvid appeared just outside [[Crow's Perch]], trying to dare anyone that crossed his path to a duel.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt runs into him all 3 times}} Not paying attention to what [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] was, Ronvid forced the [[witcher]] to fight him but was easily overpowered. He then vowed he'd defeat Geralt later before heading off and eventually ended up just outside [[Novigrad]]. Geralt happened to cross his path again and this time Ronvid had a shield and a little bit more armor. However, this didn't help in the least and Ronvid was defeated yet again. After this, Ronvid finally realized Geralt was a witcher and proceeded to hire a couple thugs to try and even the playing field, eventually running into the witcher a third time within the [[Silverton]] district.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt uses [[Axii]] on them}} Now calmed down, Ronvid decided to finally take the witcher's advice and stopped trying to fight him before heading off to sit along the piers.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt doesn't use Axii}} Unswayed by trying to face off against a witcher with 2 thugs with him, Ronvid sadly met his end in Novigrad, having not even defeated one knight.

== Notes ==
* The difficulty of the fight is elevated with each encounter. He starts off with nothing but a blade. He later appears bearing a shield, while boasting about his training with it. Finally, the knight recruits two allies to assist him.
* If Ronvid is killed, a document titled [[To the Most Beautiful Woman in the World]] may be looted off his body.
* A girl named Bilberry is mentioned to have died on a post made on a [[Notice board (Crow's Perch)|notice board]]. The notice says that Bilberry was only 4 years old, however it's unclear if this has any relation to Ronvid, although this seems very unlikely.
* Ronvid could be based on another character from the franchise, the [[Chevron Knight]].
