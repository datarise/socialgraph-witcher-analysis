'''Gert Borel''' was a peasant that hauled [[Catriona plague|plague]] victims' bodies as he was confident he was immune to it considering all his life he never got sick. However, later on he was found wandering the battlefields of southern [[Velen]] (near a burned-out settlement east of [[Reardon Manor]]), begging for death, having come down with the plague himself. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can choose to end his suffering and burn his body.
