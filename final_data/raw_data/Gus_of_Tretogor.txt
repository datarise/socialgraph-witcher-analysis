'''Gus of Tretogor''' was a mage and close colleague of [[Carduin]] with whom he was trying to reactivate [[Council of Wizards|Council]] and [[Chapter of the Gift and the Art|Conclave]] to its former glory on the summit at [[Loc Muinne]] in {{Tw2}}.

He thought that [[John Natalis]] would be a challenge to convince as he was too honest. But the only thing he feared was that those mages that did not come to debates, like [[Francesca Findabair|Francesca]], [[Ida Emean aep Sivney|Ida]] and [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]], would be the first to criticise.
==Trivia==
*Gus is English form of Latin name Augustus meaning ''majestic''.
