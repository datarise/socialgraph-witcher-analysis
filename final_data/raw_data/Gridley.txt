:''[[Rupert]]'s friend was in a dire state, lost amidst somber ruins in a wilderness forsaken by gods and humans alike. [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] found him easily and learned more about him, including what had led him to take such risks.''
:''Gridley had been stationed in the area during the war. His unit had tortured a Nilfgaardian soldier to death, all in the name of finding a treasure. Years later, the [[Nilfgaardian's wraith|murdered man's wraith]] used its power to force Gridley and Rupert to return to the site of their crime.''
:'''If Geralt decides to give him and Rupert to the wraith:'''
::''Gridley shared Rupert's fate and paid for his past crimes, for Geralt decided that he would not stop the wraith from exacting revenge.''
:'''If Geralt decides to give him and Rupert to [[Bernard Loredo|Loredo]]:'''
::''Geralt did not hand Gridley over to the damned soul, yet he decided that both [[Rupert]] and Gridley needed to pay for their deeds. Their fate was sealed when a certain woman intervened – the degenerates had committed other crimes for which they would now face punishment.''
:'''If Geralt tells him and Rupert to go away:'''
::''Geralt did not hand Gridley over to the damned soul, yet he drove him and his friend away, ordering the villains to leave the area immediately.''
:'''If the quest fails:'''
::''Subsequent events hit Geralt like an avalanche, so he never learned the end of Gridley's and Rupert's story. We can only guess at the fate of the two adventurers, but I leave that to the reader's imagination.''
