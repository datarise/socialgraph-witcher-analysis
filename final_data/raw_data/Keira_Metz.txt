'''Keira Metz '''of [[Carreras]] was a [[sorceress]] and former advisor to [[King]] [[Foltest]] of [[Temeria]], a role that had also been held by [[Triss Merigold]] and [[Fercart]].

== Biography ==
===Thanedd banquet===
In early {{Year|canon=yes|year=1267}}, Keira was serving as King Foltest's advisor when she and other mages in the [[Northern Kingdoms|North]] learned some of their fellow mages were planning to betray the [[Brotherhood of Sorcerers]] for [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]]. Armed with this information, a conclave was called on [[Thanedd Island]] under the pretense of figuring out what they should do in regards to their positions as advisors to various rulers. In reality, Keira along with several others, including [[Philippa Eilhart]] and [[Sabrina Glevissig]], planned a [[Thanedd coup|coup]] of their own to try and prevent the Nilfgaard supporters from putting their coup into play first.

When she attended the banquet the night before the conclave, she met [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], who'd been brought along by [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]], and the two conversed for a bit, with the [[witcher]] joking that he had created the caviar illusion and her noting she didn't want to drink as she planned "to get pregnant tonight" before [[Marti Södergren]] butted in and the trio discussed trivial matters before Keira walked off to talk with other mages there.<ref name="toc" />

=== Thanedd Coup===
However, Keira's real reason for not wanting to drink that night was to prevent herself from falling asleep. While everyone else headed off to bed, the Northern supporters planned to stay awake to arrest the traitors. As dawn approached, they made their move and Keira, with assistance from [[Sigismund Dijkstra]] and some of his [[Redania]]n soldiers, began to apprehend the traitors. As they were in the process of capturing [[Artaud Terranova]], Geralt stumbled upon them but the soldiers held him off while Terranova was handcuffed, but not before the mage insulted Keira who, in turn, punched him with brass knuckles straight to the face. On seeing Geralt, she demanded that they guard him and hurried off before returning with [[Detmold]], wondering what to do about the witcher. After deciding Philippa could decide, the two mages then hurried off to continue the arrests. A short time later, Keira and [[Radcliffe]] apprehended [[Francesca Findabair]] and [[Fercart]] and brought them to where the rest of the supporters were waiting before moving them to [[Garstang]].

However, the plan soon fell apart and a battle erupted between the two sides in Garstang. Keira had been overpowered by them and Terranova proceeded to throw her out of a window but Geralt, who'd been on his way into the tower to find Yennefer, happened to be just below and she instead landed on the witcher. Suffering from a broken leg and ribs, Keira had Geralt carry her so she could show him the way in, meanwhile explaining all that had transpired right before the fight broke out.<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref> Keira managed to survive despite her wounds but, having been exiled by her king, took refuge in [[Montecalvo]], Philippa's castle, along with [[Triss Merigold]].<ref name="bof">{{BoF}}</ref>

=== Joining the Lodge ===
In early August, she joined Philippa's plans to create a new mage organization, the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]], attending both the first and second meeting on the 19th of that month. However, like many of the other sorceresses in attendance, she wrongly believed Yennefer had sided with Nilfgaard during the coup and, along with Sabrina, made occasional scathing remarks towards the black-haired sorceress.<ref name="bof" />

As January {{Year|canon = yes|year = 1268}} rolled around, another member of the Lodge, [[Fringilla Vigo]], had seduced Geralt when his travels took him into [[Toussaint]], hoping to keep him there until Spring. However, Geralt learned where [[Vilgefortz]] was and proceeded to make haste, but not before Fringilla got him to tell her the location and, in turn, informed the Lodge. Believing they had the upper hand, Keira and Sabrina were sent to ambush the hideout, [[Rhys-Rhun Castle]], to get [[Ciri]], but when they arrived they realized Geralt was smarter than they realized: he had given Fringilla a false location that'd been abandoned for years.<ref>{{TLotL}}</ref>

== Appearance and personality ==
Keira was short and slim with long, straight, straw-coloured hair. She had a small mole above her left breast, and wore expensive clothing, such as a green tulle top and horned agama skin slippers to the Thanedd ball. Around her neck she wore an ankh cross; silver and set with zircon. Fond of luxury, she despised the dirtiness of the outdoors, and was rather eccentric in nature.<ref name="toc" />

== {{Tw2}} ==
Keira Metz was mentioned in a conversation with [[Cynthia]] ([[Iorveth]]'s path). Also her name was one of the names that ambassador [[Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen]] listed as a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, who were accused of being behind the deaths of both [[Demavend III|Demavend]] and Foltest. She was condemned to death with the other members of the Lodge.

== {{tw3}} ==
In ''The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'', Keira Metz was in hiding, fearing the wrath of the [[Witch hunter|witch hunters]]. She was first encountered while pretending to be a witch in the village of [[Midcopse]]. After spotting Geralt outside her [[Keira Metz's hut|cottage]], Keira retreated to a secret, magically-generated chamber. She called out to Geralt from the top of a magic bath, and, when he arrived, coyly presented the witcher with a view of her nude form. From there, her and Geralt traveled to underground [[Elf|elven]] ruins near [[Duén Hen]] to look for Ciri. After wandering round in the dark, they encountered the [[Wild Hunt]]. One of the Wild Hunt warriors, [[Nithral]], attacked them, and after defeating him, Keira and Geralt continued to find the [[Avallac'h|mysterious elf]]'s hideout. Throughout her involvement in ''The Witcher 3'', Keira kept up a subtle, sexually-charged rapport with Geralt.

In combat, Keira made use of her [[air]] magic, utilizing lightning [[Bolt (spell)|bolts]] and [[levitation]] spells to battle multiple enemies.

=== Sells ===
While Keira was in [[Velen]], she acted like an alchemy shopkeeper and would buy and sell related items; she also offered these services at [[Kaer Morhen]] prior to the battle against the Wild Hunt:
* sells every diagram for every [[runestone]] and [[glyph]] in the base game (from lesser to greater)
* sells every type of runestone and glyph in the base game (1 of each)
* sells a Potion of Clearance
* sells [[Manuscript page: Beast oil]]
* sells [[Manuscript page: Northern Wind]]
* sells [[Formula: Quebrith]]
* various [[The Witcher 3 alchemy ingredients|alchemy ingredients]]

Due to a glitch, if Geralt returns to Kaer Morhen after having left it during [[Blood on the Battlefield]], Keira's alchemist icon will be visible in a remote part of the map; once reached, she once again acts like an alchemist shop. However there is no way to get back into Kaer Morhen once she is reached as the door leading behind the castle is locked. This means the only way of leaving the area alive is glitching down the slope next to the castle wall on Roach's back.

=== Journal Entry ===
:''Geralt first met Keira Metz when she literally dropped on top of him out of nowhere. During the infamous coup on Thanedd Island, Keira was defenestrated and nearly landed right on the witcher's head. The next time Geralt saw her, in the swamps of Velen, was shocking in a different way - the luxury-loving sorceress was the last person he expected to see in such a grim and barren place.''
:''Geralt later learned the reason for this, and Keira's fate gave him ample fodder for contemplating the cruel whimsies of the wheel of fortune. Once the esteemed advisor to the now late King Foltest, she had been chased out of Temeria when she lost that ruler's trust. Later she joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, which earned her the hatred of Redania's king and Nilfgaard's emperor alike. Because of this, she had gone deep undercover, posing as a cunning woman, a village witch of sorts, deep in the Velen boondocks. It was not at all difficult to tell that she despised every minute of this.''
:''Keira then asked Geralt for another favor: lifting the curse from the tower of [[Fyke Isle]]. Curses and favors being what Geralt does best, he obliged.''
:''Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal.''
:'''If Geralt does not sleep with Keira:'''
::''Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation for dinner - but showing unusual restraint, turned down her other, decidedly unambiguous propositions.''
:'''If Geralt does sleep with Keira:'''
::''Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation - and continued saying yes all evening.''
:''Sadly, an evening that started out so nicely ended quite unfortunately for the witcher. Keira put him to sleep with a secretly-cast spell. Clearly, she wanted to hide something from him...''
:''It turned out that Keira had played the witcher like a well-tuned harp, strumming all the right chords to keep him occupied while she stole the mage [[Alexander's notes]] from Fyke Isle. She was planning to use the notes as a bargaining chip while making a deal with Radovid. His plague research could be her ticket back to life without lice, ticks and omnipresent filth.''
:'''If Geralt refuses to let Keira go to Radovid:'''
::''Keira was determined to get her way, but Geralt could not allow her to carry out her plans. Both refused to budge, leading to a fight in which Keira Metz lost her life.''
:'''If Geralt convinces Keira to go to Kaer Morhen:'''
::''In the end Geralt succeeded in squelching Keira's mad plan to bargain with a man whose favorite negotiating tools were red-hot pincers and burning pyres. Keira changed her destination from [[Oxenfurt]] to the decidedly safer confines of Kaer Morhen.''
::''During the battle for Kaer Morhen Keira fought bravely against [[Eredin Bréacc Glas|Eredin]]'s minions and saved [[Lambert]] from certain death.''
::''Later it turned out that fighting side by side had forged a bond between Keira and Lambert and they decided to continue developing it after the battle was over. This confirmed my theory that witchers and sorceresses clearly share some mystical mutual attraction.''
:'''If Geralt let Keira go [[A Final Kindness|parley]] with Radovid:'''
::''Though her planned move was as stupid as it was risky, Keira was deaf to all Geralt's arguments. In the end he had to admit he had no right to stop her, and so Keira left, taking Alexander's notes with her.''

== Trivia ==
* If Geralt let Keira go to Radovid, her body can be [[A Final Kindness|recovered later with Triss]]. After taking it down from a stake, Triss will sit for a moment with her dead friend's body in a similar position to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo Michangelo]'s famous sculpture, ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo) Pietà]'', in which the Virgin Mary holds Jesus' body after it was taken down from the cross.

== Notes ==
*In {{Tw1}}, it's speculated that it's either Philippa or Keira that spoke to Triss Merigold through a [[Telecommunicator|mirror]] while Geralt was unconscious.
* Geralt can fight and kill Keira in an attempt to stop her from handing [[Alexander]]'s research notes to [[Radovid V|Radovid]] as a bargaining chip to save her life and return her to luxury.
** If you kill Keira, she will not be available for Brother In Arms: Velen later in the storyline.
* Geralt can convince Keira to go to Kaer Morhen instead of stopping her or allowing her to go to Radovid.
* In {{Tw3}}, there is a [[Keira Metz (gwent card)|Gwent card]] depicting her in the [[Northern Realms Gwent deck|Northern Realms deck]].

== Bugs ==

*Keira can sometimes still be found at the funeral pyre at Kaer Morhen after the Epilogue. If so, she will have the same dialogue option available while she was in hiding and will even be available as a merchant.
