}}'''Narcissa''' was a [[prostitute]] working in the [[Passiflora]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. Despite the [[Eternal Fire]] condemning prostitution, many [[Temple Guard]]s use the Passiflora's services and treat the women well.

== Notes ==
* Due to her using the same hair model as [[Tamara Strenger]], some players confuse her with the [[Phillip Strenger|Bloody Baron]]'s daughter.
