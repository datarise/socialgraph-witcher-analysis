'''Old Sage''' was a soothsayer living in [[Benek]] who got his seer abilities in his youth when he got hit in the back of the head with a rock. However, his gift doesn't let him see what would help him win at [[gwent]] but, despite this, he's considered one of [[Velen]]'s best [[gwent]] players.

He uses the [[Monsters Gwent deck|Monsters deck]] and if beaten he gives the [[Crone: Weavess (gwent card)|Crone: Weavess card]] as a reward.

==Trivia==
*The joke the old sage told about falling into a witch's magical brew as a child before getting his visions could be a reference to Obelix from ''Asterix and Obelix ''comic series, who fell into his village druid's brew of potion as a baby which made him inhumanly strong.
