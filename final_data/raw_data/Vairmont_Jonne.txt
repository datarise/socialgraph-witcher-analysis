== Biography ==
In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, he happened across a map that was said to lead to the Dar'Ah Manuscript, a supposedly priceless [[Elf|elven]] tome that could give valuable insight into the [[Aen Seidhe]]'s history. The map led him to the elven ruins beneath [[Novigrad]] but he was unable to search for it as a sarcophagus in the ruins was sealed up tight.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps him}} Spotting the [[witcher]], Vairmont got [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to help him unseal the tomb, only for them to find a rather annoyed [[vampire]] inside who promptly shut the lid once more. However, Vairmont didn't have a chance to look for the manuscript and asked for the witcher to open it again.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt checks it again}} now angry at being woken up again, the vampire attacked the men, leaving Geralt no choice but to kill it. For his part, Vairmont merely noted how he didn't get a chance to ask the vampire about the manuscript before shrugging it off and to continue searching.
