'''Iron Mortimer''' was the [[captain]] of the [[Temple Guard]] and one of the fistfighters in [[Novigrad]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}.

== Fighting tactics ==
He's a tough, sinewy chap with a constitution to match his name, so more counters than usual are necessary. Timing and patience are required.

Once you land a successful counter, make sure to follow with one or two quick jabs with a heavy punch before withdrawing before he can regain his composure.<ref>The official [https://www.primagames.com/games/witcher-3 Prima guide]</ref>
