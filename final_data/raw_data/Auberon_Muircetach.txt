'''Auberon Muircetach, King of the Alders''', was the [[king]] of the [[Aen Elle]] [[elf|elves]], an [[Aen Saevherne]], and ruler of [[Tir ná Lia]]. He was determined to "take back" what had been stolen from the Aen Elle by [[Cregennan of Lod|Cregennan]] when he took [[Lara Dorren]], Auberon's daughter. To do this, he had [[Ciri]], a descendant of the two lovers, brought to him and groomed to produce an heir. He was notably patient and never brutal, but nor would he be dissuaded from his goal.

He died before he was able to impregnate Ciri; killed, possibly unwittingly, possibly not, from an overdose of an aphrodisiac or performance enhancer at the age of over 650 years supplied by [[Eredin Bréacc Glas]], who viewed himself as a more suitable ruler.

Auberon Muircetach appeared only in a dream summoned by [[Corinne Tilly|Corinne]] showing the moment shortly before his death. This vision was used to convince [[Ge'els]] to betray Eredin.

=== Journal Entry ===

He died after being poisoned by Eredin Bréacc Glas, who then declared himself king. At the time of his death Auberon had been exhausted and embittered by over six hundred and fifty years of living.''
