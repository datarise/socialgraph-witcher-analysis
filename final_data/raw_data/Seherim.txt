'''Seherim''' is a secondary character in Chapter I of {{Tw2}}. He is one of the elves who live in [[Lobinden]] and can be found on the observation tower, often in the company of [[Cedric (elf)|Cedric]]. He is tormented by the loss of his partner, [[Moril]], who disappeared under mysterious circumstances nearly a year earlier.

If Geralt sides with [[Vernon]], he and [[Ves]] find Moril, heavily pregnant and being held prisoner by [[Bernard Loredo]]. During the rescue, Moril gives birth to a baby boy, but such is her despair that she commits suicide. Geralt then leaves the child in Seherim's care.
