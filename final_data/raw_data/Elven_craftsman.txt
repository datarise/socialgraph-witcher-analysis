The '''elven craftsman''' was part of [[Toruviel]]'s band of starving [[elf|elves]] who camped in the [[Elven cave|cave]] by the [[Lakeside]] in [[Murky Waters]]. He was looking for four [[Chitinous carapace|pieces of centipede armor]] for his work and was willing to pay. He was also a master craftsman, though the term slightly offended his artistic nature, and was capable of doing many things: mirror reassembly being one such skill.

He was well versed in the history of [[Raven's armor]].
