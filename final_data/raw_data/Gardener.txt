|Appears_games = {{Tw1}}}}The '''Gardener''' is a veteran of the war with [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]], when he was part of [[Julia Abatemarco|Julia "Pretty Kitty" Abatemarco]]'s corps of mercenaries in [[Adieu's Free Company]]. He also fought across half the world with Pretty Kitty, even as far as [[Zerrikania]], where he got his extensive knowledge of Zerrikanian insects and geography. Now, in his retirement, he happily tends to the garden of [[St. Lebioda's Hospital]] in the [[Temple Quarter]] of [[Vizima]]. He is a novice [[The Witcher dice poker|dice]] player, but has extraordinary luck, often coming back from the brink of defeat and taking all of your orens, and Geralt can barter with him.

He buys and sells:
* Herbs:
** [[Balisse]]
** [[Beggartick blossoms|Beggartick]]
** [[Berbercane fruit|Berbercane]]
** [[Celandine]]
** [[Fool's parsley leaves|Fool's parlsey]]
** [[Hellebore petals|Hellebore]]
** [[Verbena]]
** [[White myrtle petals|White myrtle]]
** [[Mistletoe]]
** [[Sewant mushroom]]s
** [[Wolf's aloe leaves|Wolf's aloe]]
** [[Wolfsbane]]
* [[Flowers]]: all kinds
* [[The Witcher food and drink|food]]: all kinds

== Associated Quests ==
* [[The Echinops Contract]]
* [[Memory of a Blade]]
* [[Dice Poker: The Novice]], as a possible opponent

== Notes ==
* He provides a [[Zerrikania|glossary entry]] on [[Zerrikania]] in exchange for [[The Witcher food and drink|food]], which negates the need for you to purchase the book [[Zerrikanian Insects and Other Vermin]] necessary for the autopsy in the quest [[Anatomy of a Crime]].
* He will also give Geralt red, yellow or white [[Flowers|roses]] in exchange for food. This has potential for some money making: Give the Gardener "junk" food that you would normally sell for 1 {{oren}}, then sell the roses for 6 {{oren}}.
* If Geralt does not specify a preferred color of roses, the Gardener will give a random color of the three available types.
