Unnamed sister}}'''Shady merchant''' was an unnamed man located on the [[Velen]] side of the [[Border Post]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, where he made and sold counterfeit [[Transit pass|transit passes]] for refugees looking to cross over to [[Redania]]. Even though this was technically illegal, the nearby guards knew about this and even made hints to others that there were other ways to obtain a pass.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt talks to him}} he'll offer [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] a pass for 100 {{Crown}}. If the [[witcher]] balked at it, he then offered a discount if the witcher would help his brother-in-law, [[Albin Hart]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Albin and he survives}} pleased, the merchant then offered to sell the pass to Geralt for 25 {{Crown}}.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Albin but he dies}} upset over this, the merchant refused to do anymore business with Geralt.
