'''Bolton of Ironford''' was a [[Nordling]] [[knight]].

== Biography ==
Sometime in the 13th century, Bolton and his squire traveled to [[Temeria]] to enlist in its notorious [[The Witcher 2 Arena|Grand Arena]]. Unluckily, [[necrophage]]s ambushed them just when they were nearing the arena gates. Alone as the squire fled and died in a nearby river, Bolton fought the beasts off but was badly wounded.

Luckily, [[Geralt of Rivia]] was passing by a while later and made him a [[healing brew]]. Bolton then gave Geralt his arena invitation to show his gratitude.<ref>{{Tw2}}</ref>

== Notes ==
* In {{Tw2}} Polish version, he's named "Eryk of the Crossing" (''Eryk z Przeprawy''). Reason for this remains unknown.
