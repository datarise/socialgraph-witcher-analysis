'''Timmon''' was a [[Skellige|Skelliger]] living in [[Harviken]] on [[Faroe Isle]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}. He was engaged to [[Agda]] and they were to be married once she arrived in Harviken.

== Biography ==
While he prepared for his wedding, his brothers, [[Ulf (Timmon's brother)|Ulf]] and [[Mikkel (Skelliger)|Mikkel]], were sent to pick up Agda and bring her to Faroe. Unfortunately, a storm hit during their trip back and Agda drowned. Rather than face Timmon over their disgrace at failing to protect Agda, his brothers then committed suicide to maintain their honor.

* If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] finds out what happened and let Timmon know, Timmon will later set up an altar at the crashed site.
