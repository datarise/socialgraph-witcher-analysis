'''Igor''' was the local [[herbalist]] of [[Lurtch]], until {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, when he was transformed into a [[pig]].

== Biography ==
He and the other villagers, save [[Yontek]], robbed from a nearby altar, not realizing it was cursed. Shortly thereafter all the villagers turned into pigs and somehow Igor got left behind at the altar location, now in pig form.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt visited the "Hog Hut"}} the [[witcher]] found Igor and proceeded to have a "conversation" with him in the form of oinking a number of times for yes or no. After this, Geralt could then help lift the curse, transforming Igor back to [[human]] form.
