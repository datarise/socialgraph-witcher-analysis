'''Ele'yas''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He is briefly seen during Chapter I at the beginning of [[At a Crossroads: Scoia'tael]] when Iorveth tells him to ready his unit to march. In Chapter II, on Iorveth's path, he is initially found loitering outside [[The Cauldron]], near the notice board.

If Geralt sides with the [[Succubus (Vergen)|succubus]] and denounces Ele'yas to [[Iorveth]], the elf lies in wait and ambushes the witcher in the [[burned village]].

== Journal Entry ==
:''Scoia'tael units are made up chiefly of young, rash elves who need not think twice before they take up arms in the fight for nonhuman freedom. Ele'yas was one such elf, and was considered one of the best warriors in Iorveth's unit to boot.''
:'''If Geralt sides with the [[Succubus (Vergen)|succubus]] during Chapter II - With Flickering Heart:'''
::''Ele'yas hired the witcher to kill a succubus, a monster that seduced and killed young men. The succubus, however, claimed that the jealous elf was actually the murderer. Indeed, there was evidence to prove her claim against Ele'yas. When the witcher decided to tell Iorveth about his suspicions, Ele'yas took the chance and fled, a fact that would support the notion his conscience was burdened.''

Indeed, there was evidence to prove her claim against Ele'yas. In this situation the witcher decided that killing Iorveth's adjutant would prove to be the lesser evil. And so, after a short fight, Ele'yas' life ended.''

::''Ele'yas hired the witcher to kill a succubus, a monster that seduced and killed young men. The succubus, however, claimed that the jealous elf was actually the murderer. Geralt did not believe a single word from the monster's mouth and ended its existence, gaining the gratitude of Iorveth's adjutant in the process.''
