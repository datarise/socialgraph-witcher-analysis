'''Duke''' and his associate, [[Earl (gangster)|Earl]] are [[Gwent]] card collectors and minor thief captains willing to use intimidation to get the cards they want. When you ask [[Zoltan Chivay]] on his topic, he will say that after the fall of [[Cyprian Wiley|Whoreson Junior]] he is rising in the [[Novigrad]]ian underworld.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[A Dangerous Game]]

== Trivia ==
* After a chase, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can finally corner Duke in the sewers where he can either let him go or "finish him". If he kills him however, the man can still be found later, apparently neither dead nor undead, in the same spot, though he has little to say.
