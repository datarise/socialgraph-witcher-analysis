The '''Fisher King '''and his [[Hermit|druid friend]] were followers and servants of the powerful [[nymph]] known as the [[Lady of the Lake (nymph)|Lady of the Lake]].

== Biography ==
In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1270}}, the Fisher King lived in a [[Fisher King's hut|modest hut]] on the [[Lakeside|lakeshore]] outside [[Murky Waters]], serving the Lady of the Lake, and according to the hermit, helped take care of the village. He also seemed to be the postmaster for the village and handled the delivery of a letter from [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to his lover to [[Vizima]]. The Lady herself suggested that he was her lover, on at least one occasion.

At his hut, Geralt found him to ask about borrowing his boat to get to [[Black Tern Island]]. His mostly silent nature thankfully didn't pose a problem, and he relented.<ref>{{Tw1}}</ref>

In {{Year|canon = no|year = 1275}}, the Fisher King and the hermit followed the Lady of the Lake to [[Lac Célavy]] in [[Toussaint]]. He most likely transported common, but worthy folks on the island to the Lady's islet, and collected herbs.<ref>{{BaW}}</ref>

He was not a very talkative guy, and managed to communicate mostly with a series of ''Mhm's'' and ''Uhm's,'' except for when motivated to talk.
