==Biography==

In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, he and [[Ulf (Timmon's brother)|Ulf]] were escorting Timmon's fiancée, [[Agda]], to where Timmon and Agda where getting married. Sadly a storm hit and the boat crashed, killing Agda. Rather than face their brother over their disgrace at failing to protect Agda, his two brothers then committed suicide to maintain their honor.

[[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can use [[Keira Metz]]'s [[Magic lamp (quest item)|magic lamp]] to see the conversation Ulf and Mikkel had before they died and find their bodies.
