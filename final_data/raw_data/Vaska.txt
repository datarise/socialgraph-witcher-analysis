'''Vaska''' was the eldress of the [[Brickmakers' village]]. These simple folk live in the [[swamp]], surrounded by Clay Pits, the [[Sephirot|Maal'kad]] and [[Sephirot|Y'esath]] obelisks. She worships the [[Water Lords]] — probably [[vodyanoi]] — and is quite touchy when it comes to them. She talks in riddles and seems a bit crazy, but her flock respects her and she does provide some useful information.

She can be found during Chapters II and III either inside her hut, or just outside, doing her laundry. In the Epilogue, she reappears at the [[safe house]] in the [[Temple Quarter]] where she gives Geralt one last piece of advice regarding his destiny.
