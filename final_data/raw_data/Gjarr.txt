'''Gjarr''' was the village elder of [[Blandare]], a miners settlement in the middle of [[Ard Skellig]].

==Biography==
In {{Year|year=1272|canon=yes}}, despite knowing of a possible [[Wham-a-Wham|troll]] in the northern caves, he decided to send men anyways to see if they could mine some silver. However, when they lost contact with the miners, he put out a notice hoping someone would help learn what happened to them.
