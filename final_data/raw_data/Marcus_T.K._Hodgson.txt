'''Marcus Thaddeus Knut Hodgson''' was a [[The Witcher 3 merchants|merchant]], owning [[Books and Scrolls]] in [[Novigrad]]'s [[Hierarch Square]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272
|Type = game}}, and one of the few who greatly admired the artist [[van Rogh]].

You can play [[gwent]] with him though he doesn't give any unique cards.

== Biography ==
Sometime prior to {{Year|canon = no|year = 1270
|Type = game}}, [[Jacques de Aldersberg]] stopped by, giving Marcus a [[My Manifesto - The Life of Jacques de Aldersberg|book]] with a [[Letter from "A"|letter]] inside and instructing the shopkeeper to give it to the [[witcher]] [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] if the witcher ever visited the shop. The book proceeded to sit around the shop for years, with Marcus not believing such a person would ever drop by.

At some point another witcher, [[Gaetan]], dropped in and left behind a [[Conserved shaelmaar trophy|trophy]] as collateral, but failed to come back for it.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt visits}} One day in 1272, Geralt did visit much to Marcus' surprise. Having not forgotten about the book, he then informed Geralt about it, though he forgot where he placed it. Thankfully the witcher was able to find the book in question.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt brings and sells him the painting}} Geralt learned about Marcus being a fierce admirer of van Rogh and proceeded to bring him "[[Starry Night Over the Pontar|Starry Night over the Pontar]]". Marcus, excited over owning it, readily paid for the painting and hung it up in his store.
