'''Lasota''' is a secondary character in {{Tw2}}. He is a [[The Witcher 2 merchants|merchant]], [[craftsman]], and [[The Witcher 2 dice poker|dice poker player]] who can be found in the first tent northeast of the main entrance to the [[Kaedweni camp]] during Chapter II.

If you beat him during the [[Poker Face: Kaedweni Camp]] quest, he'll give you the option of taking gold or one of three crafting diagrams: [[Diagram: Leather|leather]], [[Diagram: Hardened leather|hardened leather]], or [[Diagram: Studded leather|studded leather]]. Note that while the dialogue seems to indicate that you will get the armor diagram, you only actually get the diagram for the material itself.

== [[The Witcher 2 journal|Journal]] Entry ==
: ''When it turned out that the break-up letter from his beloved had just been a bad joke, Lasota proved to be a really helpful person. As the quartermaster's assistant, he had access to both armor and weapons, obviously for a price.''
