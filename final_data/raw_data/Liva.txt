}}'''Liva''' was a [[medic]] working in the [[Kaedweni camp]] in 1271.

== Journal Entry ==
:''Because the hygiene of nearly every army's troops leaves a lot to be desired, military brothels have a reputation as dens of questionable pleasure and indubitable gonorrhea. Therefore Liva, fulfilling both the role of camp follower and medic, was an important element of the military machine. A brothel without medical supervision can easily turn into a seed of infirmity, and that is just one step away from becoming a source of sabotage and damaging military capability.''
:''Liva had worked in the camp during the previous [[Kaedwen]]i-[[Aedirn|Aedernian]] campaign, and knew a lot about the events of those terrible days.''
