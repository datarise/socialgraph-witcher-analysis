'''Beast Tamer''' was a traveling showman in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, selling tickets for people to see rare and exciting creatures like a [[basilisk]]. In reality, the guy was either ignorant or deliberately cheating people out of their money, as it wasn't a basilisk he had but a young, ill-fed [[wyvern]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt intervenes}} as he showed off the "basilisk" to a group of [[Redania]]n soldiers, the [[witcher]] came forth, eventually pointing out it was a wyvern. Realizing they'd been had, the soldiers began to move in to grab the man when the beast's cage suddenly broke and the wyvern got out while the "beast tamer" hid.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[The Most Truest of Basilisks]]

== Notes ==
* He's a direct reference to a scene in the {{ToC}}, except it was [[Ciri]] that pointed out it was a wyvern before the cage broke.
