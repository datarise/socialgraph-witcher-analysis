'''Dea Strenger''' was the [[Phillip Strenger|Bloody Baron]]'s unborn daughter. After his wife [[Anna Strenger|Anna]] miscarried, she turned into a [[botchling]].

When [[Geralt of Rivia]] went to visit the Baron he came to the botchling's grave, unfilled and empty. He saw the botchling and had to make a choice.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt spared the botchling}} Geralt guided Phillip through an ancient naming ritual and Phillip named the stillborn Dea before burying her under the home's doorway. Later she turned into a [[lubberkin]] and helped him find the trails of Anna and their daughter [[Tamara Strenger|Tamara]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt killed the botchling}} Phillip became upset at the witcher for killing his child once more, though nothing else could be done then.
