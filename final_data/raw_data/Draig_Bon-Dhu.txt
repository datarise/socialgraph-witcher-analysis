'''Draig Bon-Dhu''' was a young [[skald]] from [[Skellige]] who accompanied [[Eist Tuirseach]], [[Crach an Craite]], and [[Mousesack]] to the feast held by [[Queen]] [[Calanthe]] in honour of her daughter, the Princess [[Pavetta]]'s [[A Question of Price|coming of age]].

He was described as "a strapping fellow with bagpipes".

== {{Tw3}} ==
He appeared only briefly at [[Kaer Trolde]], where he performed a ballad about [[Hjalmar]] slaying the [[Ice Giant|giant]] on [[Undvik]]. Later on he was among the victims of the [[Berserker (creature)|Berserker]] attack.

=== Associated Quest ===
* [[King's Gambit]]

== Notes ==
* In [[A Question of Price]] he played the bagpipes while in {{Tw3}} he plays a lute.
* He does not have a unique model, therefore it is possible to see "him" playing at the [[Coronation]] among other skalds.
