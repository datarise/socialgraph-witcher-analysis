'''Loan Shark''' was a [[merchant]] in [[The Bits]] district of [[Novigrad]]. While he normally just gave out loans, he did sell a few items like the book [[Change your life! A Handbook]]. He also played [[gwent]], using the [[Monsters Gwent deck|monsters deck]].

==Biography==
At some point, the merchant came into business with the pirate [[Morkvarg]] from [[Skellige]]. He gave the man a loan, and the two went into business often.

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt lets Morkvarg live}} In {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, on Morkvarg's instructions, [[Geralt of Rivia]] came to the loan shark's pawnshop and retrieved an [[Torn-out page: Werewolf decoction|alchemy formula]] and the sword [[Deithwen (sword)|Deithwen]], which Morkvarg had left there.
