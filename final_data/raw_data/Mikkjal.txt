'''Mikkjal''' was the caretaker of [[Eldberg Lighthouse]] in western [[Ard Skellig]] and belonged to [[Clan Drummond]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}.

== Biography ==
He has a rather dark secret though: using his position as the lighthouse keeper, he made a deal with others to occasionally have some ships go "astray" by not lighting the [[fire]] and thus having them crash into the island and they'd then split the spoils. However, someone eventually found out and placed a strong curse on the lighthouse and against Mikkjal in particular, which caused not just a dense fog on the island but a strong [[wraith]], known as a [[penitent]], to appear.
