==Biography==
The Temerian count signed a friendship-agreement with King [[Foltest]], before joining the rebellion on the side of [[Maria Louisa La Valette]], ultimately dying on the walls of her [[La Valette Castle|castle]].

== Journal Entry ==
:'''If Geralt manages to shoot him with a ballista bolt:'''
::''Before he got entangled in the revolt against Foltest, Sir Etcheverry was known for his valor and tenacity as a knight, proving both in more than one tournament, either mounted or on foot. Yet valiance and tenacity '''meant nothing in the face of a ballista bolt''', and thus the brave Etcheverry paid with his life for his ill-advised participation in the rebellion.''
:'''If Geralt does not manage to shoot him with a ballista bolt:'''
::''Before he got entangled in the revolt against [[Foltest]], Sir Etcheverry was known for his valor and tenacity as a knight, proving both in more than one tournament, either mounted or on foot. Yet valiance and tenacity '''were not enough to survive a cut from the witcher's blade''', and thus the brave Etcheverry paid with his life for his ill-advised participation in the rebellion.''

== Notes ==
* In order to successfully complete the achievement, Eagle Eye, you must aim dead center at the soldier on the right, as opposed to aiming directly at Count Etcheverry.
* If you miss Etcheverry with the first ballista, then you encounter him later after destroying the gate with the ballista in the courtyard. He then drops a [[Fibre enhancer]].
