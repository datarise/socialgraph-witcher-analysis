If one chooses to participate in the fighting tournaments, he can be fought. However, he makes a small request from Geralt prior to doing so: he needs the reward (a sack of flour) to feed his family and asks that you throw the match. If agreed, you can throw the match then do a rematch to continue the quest. If you choose not to throw the match, you can still give him a small sum later to feed his family if you want to.
