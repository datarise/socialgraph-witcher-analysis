'''Whispess''' was one of the three [[Velen]] [[Crones]] in [[Crookback Bog]]. The other two were [[Weavess]] and [[Brewess]] and they were supposed to be daughters of [[Whispering Hillock|She-Who-Knows]].

== Biography ==
Whispess once lived in the [[Chuchote Cave]] in [[Toussaint]], where she peered into a certain [[knight]]'s heart, she saw that it was black and refused him aid. The knight reacted with wrath and burned her alive in the cave. Soon afterward, the knight went mad and killed himself – claiming he was tortured by a strange voice whispering in his ear that no one else could hear.<ref>{{BaW}}</ref>

== Journal Entry ==
: ''The Crones of Velen were not just old — they were literally ancient, having been around since the reign of the first [[human]] [[king]]s and possibly even since the coming of the [[Elf|elves]].''
: ''Of the three ghastly sisters, the Whispess was the most ancient, or at least so claimed the swamp dwellers' whispered legends. Whispered, for if they spoke too loudly the Crone would hear it — for she demanded tribute in the form of human ears, which she hung from trees and through which, using primeval [[magic]], she heard all that happened in the swamp.''
: ''Yet no magic, new or old, could save her from Cirilla's wrath.''
