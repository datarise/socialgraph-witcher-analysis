'''Chireadan''' was an [[elf]] from the [[Redania]]n city of [[Rinde]], a tavern owner, and [[Errdil]]'s cousin.

Despite elves typically not finding [[human]]s to be attractive, he was secretly in love with [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]], though he never revealed his feelings to the sorceress. However, he didn't let his feelings get in the way when he saw that [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] was also infatuated with Yennefer and even pulled the others away when he saw the two having sex in his cousin's destroyed inn after fighting off a [[djinn]].

In Chapter IV, at the [[Lakeside]], Chireadan, an elf among [[Toruviel]]'s ragtag group recognizes Geralt. It seems he knows the witcher from somewhere before, but of course Geralt has no memory of him. This previous encounter, which is not described in any further detail, is a reference to the ''The Last Wish''.

He is also a sharper, and thus one of the available [[The Witcher spoiler checklist|dice players]]. He can be found any time, day or night to play. During the day, he is typically sitting at one of the two campfires nearest the Elven Cave. At night, he will be sleeping in the cave, but does not complain at all about being woken up just for a game.

=== Associated Quest ===
* [[Dice Poker: The Sharper]]

== Notes ==
* He appears in the illustrated comic, {{Comics|Comic=oz}}, which is based on the short story, "[[The Last Wish (short story)|The Last Wish]]".
* He was counted among the guests at Geralt and Yennefer's wedding in {{SESB}}.
