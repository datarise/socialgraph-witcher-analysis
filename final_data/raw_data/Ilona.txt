'''Ilona''' was a [[The Witcher 2 merchants|merchant]] who could be found near [[Falas]], her husband, outside of the [[Loc Muinne amphitheatre]] during Chapter III. She only sells [[The Witcher 2 food|food items]].

Although she did not initially have a beard when Geralt found her, he could get her to "grow it out". This was virtually instantaneous.

== Journal Entry ==
: ''A bearded elven woman is an exceptional sight, even if the beard is false. When there were no crowds, Ilona made ends meet by running a food shop.''
