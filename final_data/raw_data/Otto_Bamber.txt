==Biography==
In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Bamber accommodated [[Ewald Borsodi]] and his associates in a hidden cellar under his hut, while the group planned a heist on the [[Borsodi Brothers' Auction House]]. During this time, the alchemist was also accosted by [[Fallen Knight]]s, though he was protected from them by [[Geralt of Rivia]].

In the same year, Bamber's apprentice [[Folkert]], whom Bamber sent to [[Deadwight Wood]] to collect [[han fiber]], went missing. Bamber then posted a notice on the [[Brunwich]] [[notice board]] to appeal for someone to search for Folkert. Geralt of Rivia responded to this notice, and searched for the missing apprentice near the village of [[Erde]].<ref>''[[Contract: Apprentice Gone Missing!]]''</ref>

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt spared the couple but told the truth to Otto}} Bamber hired a group of mercenaries to kill the elderly couple who cannibalized Folkert, regardless of whether or not Folkert was already killed by wolves beforehand.

==Notes==
*Otto Bamber plays [[gwent]] using the [[Scoia'tael Gwent deck|Scoia'tael deck]]. If beaten at gwent, he gives a random gwent card, assuming all cards which can be obtained from playing merchants have not yet been collected.
*The quest [[Practicum in Advanced Alchemy]] may be started by speaking to this herbalist, and selecting the option "Know any master formulae?" Otto would then direct you to Gremist in [[Skellige]].
==Trivia==
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambrzy Bamber/Bambrzy] is a term used for Polish descendants of assimilated German immigrants that left the region of Bamberg to settle in the depopulated area around Poznań during the 1700s.
