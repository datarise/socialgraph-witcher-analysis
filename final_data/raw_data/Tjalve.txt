'''Tjalve''' was the son of [[Lothar (Tjalve's father)|Lothar]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}} who fell deathly ill from a cursed nithing planted by his father's scorned lover, [[Jonna]].

== Biography ==
{{Condition|Text = If Geralt investigates}} on learning Jonna had planted the nithing, he asked her to lift it, which the herbalist agreed to but with for a steep price: she wished for Lothar to denounce Tjalve, which would mean Lothar stripping his wife and son of honor and condemning them to poverty.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt gets Lothar to agree}} Lothar reluctantly agreed, and while he saved Tjalve's life by doing so, it also meant condemning him to a harsh upbringing.
:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt turns the curse on Jonna}} siding with Lothar, Geralt turned the curse on Jonna, saving the boy and allowing Lothar to stay with his family.
