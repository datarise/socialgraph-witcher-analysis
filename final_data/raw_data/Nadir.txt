[[File:Trophy_Nadir.png|thumb]]'''Nadir''' is a named [[drowned dead]] known as "the Monster of the Lake", one of the two trophy-quests in Chapter I. His head is given to the [[Royal huntsman]] as a [[The Witcher trophy quests|proof of slaying the monster]] in order to receive a reward.

He can be found just beyond the [[old mill]] at night, along with a number of [[drowner]]s. He only appears late at night.

== Associated Quests ==
* [[The Monster of the Lake]]

== Notes ==
* Nadir does not spawn during the [[Strangers in the Night (The Witcher)|Strangers in the Night]] quest but will spawn before accepting the quest or after it has been completed and Geralt has spoken to [[Haren Brogg]] about it.
* Killing his entourage first is a good strategy.
