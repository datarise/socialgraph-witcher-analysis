'''Resolute girl''' was the first person that [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] met after "arriving" at the [[lakeside]] near [[Murky Waters]]. She was a fountain of information for the [[witcher]] and filled him in on all the goings-on in the village. She also told him about the [[Friendly vodyan priest|funny fishman]] and how he guarded the [[Lady of the Lake's altar|altar to the Lady of the Lake]]. She mentioned that he was usually jolly, but was sometimes driven away from his post by [[Dagon worshipper|evil fishmen]].

In [[The Witcher storyline|Chapter IV]], she can be found almost any time, usually skipping merrily, between the [[Landing at the lakeside|landing]] and the Lady of the Lake's altar. When those evil fishmen come, she hides under the [[Fisher King (lover of Lady of the Lake)|Fisher King]]'s hut.

In the Epilogue, she is found in the [[safe house]], where she is apparently talking the ears off poor [[Vetala]].
