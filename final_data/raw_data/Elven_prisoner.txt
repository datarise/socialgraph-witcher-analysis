In the [[Kaedweni camp]], Geralt notices an elven prisoner being closely guarded and asks if he can question him. The guards initially refuse the witcher's request saying that they don't know him nor do they trust him.

Later, after having gained the trust of the Kaedweni soldiers, Geralt is allowed to question the prisoner. At first the elf is reluctant, but Geralt persists and finally gets to the elf to talk to him in [[Elder Speech]] so that the guards will not be able to understand what is being said.

== Conversation in English ==
{{Block Quote|text = '''Prisoner''': The kingslayer has two comrades. They hid among us after assassinating Demavend. [[Letho]] appeared one day and began killing without a word. The most terrible warrior I've ever seen. [[Serrit]] and [[Auckes]] are witchers too. They wear snake medallions around their necks.<br>'''Geralt''': That I know.<br>'''Prisoner''': We had no chance against them, despite our numbers. They killed everyone, but somehow overlooked me, forgot to finish me off, or believed I would die from my wounds.<br>'''Geralt''': What are their plans?<br>'''Prisoner''': They didn't mention them. We shared food and hid together, but they didn't trust us. Nor did we trust them.<br>'''Geralt''': They must have said something, mentioned their past.<br>'''Prisoner''': There is one thing... I overheard them. Serrit couldn't stand our food, and once he told Auckes he wished the Redanians would finally arrive because he dreamt of having roast beef.<br>'''Geralt''': Redanians?! What do the Redanians have to do with this?<br>'''Prisoner''': A Redanian delegation is to visit King Henselt very soon. If I understood correctly, they were to set off on their own after this visit. That's all I know.<br>'''Geralt''': Where can I find them?<br>'''Prisoner''': If they're still in the area, they must have hid in the gullies - but that's like searching for a needle in a haystack. The gullies are a real labyrinth.<br>'''Geralt''': Any idea who they're working for?<br>'''Prisoner''': I don't know, but it's someone with a deep knowledge of politics.<br>'''Geralt''': How do you know that?<br>'''Prisoner''': They know a lot. Too much for simple witchers. Do all witchers know Elder Speech?<br>'''Geralt''': I don't think so.<br>'''Prisoner''': Auckes and Serrit knew it, better than you. Much better. When you find them... May your step be soft and your breath still, witcher. Farewell.|citation = {{Tw2}}}}[[it:Prigioniero elfico]]
