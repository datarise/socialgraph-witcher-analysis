'''Vanhemar''' was a [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] [[fire]] [[mage]], [[Cynthia]]'s master, and personal sorcerer to [[Ambassador]] [[Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen]], whom he accompanied as part of the Empire's delegation.

== Biography ==
{{Condition|Text = If Roche's Path was chosen}} Vanhemar stood at Ambassador Fitz-Oesterlen's side while the latter talked with [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] at the Kaedweni camp.

{{Condition|Text = If Iorveth's Path was chosen}} Vanhemar was able to sense [[Triss Merigold]]'s presence as Geralt unwittingly carried her in figurine form to the Nilfgaardian camp. Subsequently, after taking Triss from Geralt, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen asked Vanhemar to personally execute the witcher and then congratulate [[Cynthia]] for capturing Triss.

However, as Vanhemar prepared to execute Geralt, a Nilfgaardian soldier at his side was shot by [[Ves]]; in the confusion, Geralt knocked the mage over and incapacitated him with a kick in the face. The witcher was untied by [[Vernon Roche]] and managed to acquire his sword, initiating a fight between himself and Vanhemar in which the Nilfgaardian mage was slain.

== Journal Entry ==
: ''Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen's personal sorcerer had only just made Geralt's acquaintance when he died at the witcher's hand.''
