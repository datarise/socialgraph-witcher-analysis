'''Count Felart''', a noble-born magnate of [[Upper Aedirn]].

== {{Tw2}} ==
It was him to first betray [[Aedirnian Dynasty|Crown of Aedirn]] that time represented by [[Prince]] [[Stennis]] and he would join a cooperation with other such counts to sold this territory for 100,000 Novigradian crowns (and titles of [[Marquise|marquises]] to each of them).

[[Henselt]] of [[Ard Carraigh]] accepted either half of it or nothing. Felart dies no matter the side ([[Iorveth]] / [[Vernon Roche|Roche]]) you chose.
