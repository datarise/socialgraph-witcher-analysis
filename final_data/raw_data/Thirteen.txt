}}'''Thirteen''' was a member of the elite [[Temeria]]n special forces unit, the [[Blue Stripes]]. He enjoyed a good drink and [[arm wrestling]].

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Hung Over]]

== Notes ==
* Thirteen's name is likely a bit of a homage to the character [[Fifteen]], one of [[Renfri]]'s band, in the short story "[[The Lesser Evil]]".
* Thirteen has "''13''" tattooed on the right side of his neck.
* His body is missing from the tent where the Blue Stripes were hanged. Same goes for [[Fenn (commando)|Fenn]] and [[Silas]]. It's unknown whether this was intended or an oversight.
