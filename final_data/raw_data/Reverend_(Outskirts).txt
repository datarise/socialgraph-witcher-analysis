The '''Reverend''' (Polish: ''Wielebny'') is a paranoid man who is the religious leader of the people that live in the [[Outskirts]] of [[Vizima]]. Despite his religious designation, he seems to run the Outskirts. He leads the people against the witch [[Abigail]], blaming her for the appearance of ''the Beast'', a [[hellhound]].

The Reverend can usually be found praying in the small courtyard in front of the [[Church]], or in his [[Reverend's house|house]], next door. He will gladly pontificate on the sins of others and the righteousness of the Eternal Fire.

== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ==
:''"The leader of the community in the Outskirts is a domineering priest of the [[Eternal Fire]] called the Reverend. His authority reaches well beyond the realm of the spiritual — people from the town and village in the Outskirts do exactly what he says. The Reverend is a religious fanatic and a hypocrite. He easily finds guilt where it doesn't exist, ignoring real offences.''
:''The Reverend lives in the town, just left of the temple. During the day he either prays or tends to the church.''
:''The witch Abigail was probably gone by the time I arrived at the Reverend's. Irreconcilable differences is all I can call it. We argued and I had to kill the priest.''
:''The escalating conflict between the Reverend and the local soothsayer ended grimly. A lynch mob accused Abigail of summoning the Beast and then burned her at the stake.''
:''After tending to the witch Abigail, the Reverend unleashed his congregation on me. I had to kill the priest."''

== Notes ==
* The Reverend briefly takes [[Alvin]] under his wing, so briefly in fact, that you may never actually witness it.
* He despises [[The Witcher dice poker|dice poker]], which he calls the devil's work and has forbidden.
* He had a daughter, whom he renounced and exiled (ugly story to uncover here).
* In {{BoF}}, the speech made by the priest in the refugee camp of [[Breza]] is virtually identical to the speech delivered by the Reverend in the Outskirts when the villagers try to lynch Abigail.
* There is an old woman in one of the towns nearby that states her son is ill and asks for a White Gull potion. Giving this to her, she states the Reverend would not help, so she stole his ring in which she gives to you as thanks.
