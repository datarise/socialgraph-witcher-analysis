'''Albert Vegelbud''' was an amateur alchemist from the [[Novigrad]] region and part of the wealthy [[Vegelbud family]].

== Biography ==
After [[Loc Muinne]]'s events and [[King]] [[Radovid V]]'s witch hunts, Albert became a target for his dabbling in alchemy. His mother, [[Ingrid Vegelbud]], used the family's wealth and influence to pay off the city guards to not tell the [[witch hunter]]s about her son, but somehow they still found out and planned to attack him on his [[Vegelbud Residence|family's own estate]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps Triss get Albert out of Novigrad}} with [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]]'s help, Albert was safely evacuated from his family's estate during a masquerade ball. When other hiding mages fled Novigrad, he went with them to [[Kovir and Poviss|Kovir]], a known safe haven for [[magic]] users.
