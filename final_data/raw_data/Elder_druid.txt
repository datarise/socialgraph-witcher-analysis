It is from the Elder Druid that one can purchase a variety of items during day time, including [[:Category:Plants|herbs]], [[:Category:The Witcher books|books and scrolls]]. In Chapter III, this position seems to have been taken over by the [[Hierophant]].

In Chapter V, there are several druids going by the title of "Elder druid" in the [[druids' cave]] in the [[swamp cemetery]]. They are accompanied by an ''Eldest druid'' and are preparing for [[The Green March]]. They are interested in trading potions for a number of items to help with the march.

The Elder Druid typically buy and sell the following:
* some [[Book prices|books and scrolls]], notably involving herbs: [[The Druid's Herbarium]]
* some [[:Category:Plants|herbs]]
* some [[The Witcher food and drink|food]]
