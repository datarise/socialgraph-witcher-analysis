'''Carthia van Canten''' (born {{Year|canon=yes|year=1249}}<ref>based on her being 18 during the events of {{TTotS}}</ref>), also known as '''Cantarella''', was a [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] woman with an excellent memory, a lively intelligence, and a mercurial wit working many times as a spy using her beauty to allure important men.

== Biography ==

=== Working for Assire var Anahid ===
In {{Year|canon=yes|year=1267}}, while she was still a student, [[Vattier de Rideaux]], the head of [[Nilfgaardian Secret Service]] of [[Imperator]] [[Emhyr var Emreis]], took her as his mistress. Vattier merely saw her as beautiful and pleasurable when it came to sex and liked that she barely spoke, mistaking this for her being not so bright. Unbeknownst to Vattier, she was actually very intelligent with a remarkable memory and everything he told her about his intentions, she passed to [[Assire var Anahid]].<ref>{{TTotS}}</ref>

The following year, when information from Vattier was no longer needed by Assire, Carthia left him - suddenly and unexpectedly, without giving any argument or explanation.<ref>{{TLotL}}</ref>

=== Spying in Novigrad ===
{{Canon Marker|Type=games}}In {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}, Carthia van Canten appeared at the [[Passiflora]] in [[Novigrad]] where she partook in a high-stakes [[gwent]] tournament under the pseudonym '''Sasha''', where she used the [[Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck|Nilfgaardian Empire deck]].

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt takes part in the tournament}} During the event, she offered [[Geralt of Rivia]] a deal in which they would split the winning. It turned out her participation in the tournament was a cover to allow her to gain enough money to travel back to Nilfgaard after her cover was blown.
:Geralt, however, had no time to accept or reject Sasha's proposition, because before he could do, another double dealer stole the coin set aside for the reward, beating Sasha to the punch. This thief turned out to be a [[halfling]] [[Bernard Tulle]]. The [[witcher]] raced after him and defeated him in a final showdown. They split the money and Carthia returned to Nilfgaard.<ref>{{Tw3}}</ref>

=== Mission regarding Prince Anséis ===
At one point in {{Year|canon=no|year=1275}}, when [[Prince]] [[Anséis]] of [[Lyria and Rivia]], [[Queen]] [[Meve]]'s son, was in [[Beauclair]] because of a knightly tournament that would come to pass, Carthia received a mission from [[Fringilla Vigo]] to allure him. She did just that and made him her lover but before proceeding to anything more she got a [[A letter from Prince Ansèis to Carthia van Canten|letter]] where her mission got cancelled, so she left him. Anséis was heartbroken and left his own [[A letter from Prince Ansèis to Carthia van Canten|message]] to Carthia questioning why she left him.<ref>{{Tw3}} - {{BaW}}</ref>

== Associated Quest ==
* [[High Stakes]]

== Trivia ==
* The name Cantarella is itself a reference to a supposed poison used during the Renaissance period, specifically under the Papacy of the Borgia family.

== Notes ==
* The command {{Code Font|Code = addfact(sq306_completed)}} enables an additional dialogue with [[Fringilla Vigo]] about [[Cantarella]]. For unknown reason it is not working automatically if [[High Stakes]] secondary quest is completed.
