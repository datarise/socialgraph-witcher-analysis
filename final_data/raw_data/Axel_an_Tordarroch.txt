'''Axel an Tordarroch''' was a [[Skellige]]r warrior from [[Undvik]], somehow related to the erstwhile Jarl [[Harald Houndsnout]], whom he served as one of his personal guard. When the [[ice giant]] attacked, Axel tried to reach the jarl, but he had to face some [[siren]]s and passed out during the fight. Shortly later, a longship with a few warriors guarding children and women brought the unconscious Axel to [[Ard Skellig]], where he then frequented [[The New Port]] tavern.
