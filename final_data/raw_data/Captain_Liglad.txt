}}'''Liglad''' was the captain of one of the ships docked in [[Novigrad]]'s port.

{{Condition|Text = If approached to sail to [[Skellige]]}} he refused to sail [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] to the islands, being wary of being attacked by Skelligers and [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardians]] alike, and thus advised the [[witcher]] to go find [[Captain Wolverstone]] at [[the Golden Sturgeon]] instead.
