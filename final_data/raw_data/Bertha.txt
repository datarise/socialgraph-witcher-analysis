}}'''Bertha''' was a [[prostitute]] working at [[Crippled Kate's]] in [[Novigrad]] during {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. Despite some looking down on such a line of work, Bertha enjoyed her job and was putting away savings to one day own her own [[brothel]].

== Notes ==
* Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either [[Triss Merigold|Triss]] or [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]] and will not affect any of the romance endings [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] can receive.

== Bugs ==
* In {{Patch|Game = the witcher 3|Patch = 1.30}}, Bertha always wears a top during sex scenes.
