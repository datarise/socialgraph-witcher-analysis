'''Elsa''' was the [[innkeeper]] at the [[White Orchard inn]] until {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}.

== Biography ==
At some point Elsa gave birth to a son, but the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, choking him, though his life was quickly saved by a woman named [[Annie]], who unwrapped the cord.<ref name="tw3">{{Tw3}}</ref>

=== Meeting Geralt ===
In May {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}, tensions were high after a [[Battle of White Orchard|recent defeat]] at the [[Battlefield (White Orchard)|battlefield]] in [[White Orchard]]. Elsa suffered from rumors saying she was "[[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]]'s whore", due to her taking down the [[Temeria]]n lilies, as soldiers would burn the inn if they saw it. After saving her cousin [[Bram]], the [[witcher]]s [[Geralt of Rivia]] and [[Vesemir]] met Elsa at the tavern.

:{{Condition|Text = If Geralt refused payment from Bram}} Elsa, overjoyed, thanked the witchers for saving her cousin, and gave Geralt four [[roasted chicken leg]]s.

Geralt asked whether Elsa had seen [[Yennefer of Vengerberg|Yennefer]], though she hadn't, so she recommended asking the other patrons.

=== Incident in the Tavern ===
Later, when Geralt and Vesemir were preparing to leave White Orchard, Annie's sister began accosting Elsa for removing the [[Temeria]]n lilies from the wall. The woman became violent and grabbed Elsa by the head and proceeded to bash it against the counter repeatedly. Geralt and Vesemir intervened and attracted the attention of some local men who believed that the witchers were conspiring with Emperor [[Emhyr var Emreis]]. The men refused to back down, and thus the situation ended in a massacre. Both women became terrified of the witchers, and Elsa, cowering behind the counter, told them to leave and never return.

=== Novigrad ===
Unable to continue living in White Orchard after the incident, Elsa traveled for a time and eventually ended up in [[Novigrad]]. Incidentally, while she visited [[The Kingfisher Inn]] one night and finished watching [[Priscilla]]'s performance, she spotted Geralt in the crowd and accosted him in front of the crowd, noting he was the one who "murdered those Temerian boys" in White Orchard. However, the rest of the patrons paid no mind to this and became annoyed that she was ruining the atmosphere.

After Novigrad, she settled down in a place called Rustone.

== Associated Quests ==
* [[Lilac and Gooseberries]]
* [[The Incident at White Orchard]]
* [[Broken Flowers]]

== Notes ==
*Before {{Patch|Game = 3|Patch = 1.04}}, it was required to buy Elsa's [[gwent]] cards before leaving White Orchard to avoid failing [[Collect 'Em All]], as Elsa leaves White Orchard at the same time as Geralt and ceases to be a merchant.
*As of patch 1.04, Elsa and Bram's trading inventories are partially shared which makes it possible to buy the cards from Bram instead, even after Elsa leaves White Orchard.
