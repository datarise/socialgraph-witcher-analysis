'''Midday bride''' — Two bad things can happen to a girl on her wedding day: a runaway bridegroom or transformation into a [[noonwraith]]. The latter seems to be worse, as it limits the list of wedding gifts to those people who enter the fields at high noon. They become easy prey for this [[wraith]] who wears a wedding garland on her head.

'''Note:''' The Midday Bride can either be an enemy or not.
