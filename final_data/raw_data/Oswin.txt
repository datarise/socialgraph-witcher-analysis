'''Oswin''' was the stablemaster at [[Crow's Perch]].

==Biography==
In May {{Year|year=1272|canon=no}}, the fortresses' barn was struck by lightning and set ablaze, and Oswin became trapped in the stables.

{{Condition|Text=If Geralt chose to save him}} The [[witcher]] [[Geralt of Rivia]] climbed through the roof down into the stables and opened the barred door to rescue him from the fire. He later showed his gratitude by offering a monetary reward to Geralt the next time the witcher visited Crow's Perch.
