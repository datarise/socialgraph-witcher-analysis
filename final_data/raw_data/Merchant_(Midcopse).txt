This '''merchant''' in [[Midcopse]] plays [[gwent]], using the [[Monsters Gwent deck|Monster deck]], and sells a variety of miscellaneous items. He also sells some gwent cards.
==Notes==
*He boasts a particularly pathetic monster deck where nearly all of his muster cards are impaired. Similar if not the same as the [[Downwarren]] [[Merchant (Downwarren)|merchant]], Making him an easy source of income at the beginning of the game. However, unlike the latter he is not killed off later in the game.
