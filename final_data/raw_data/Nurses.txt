{{Infobox Needed}}
If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] chose the [[The Witcher storyline|Witcher / Neutral path]], he meets two '''nurses''' upon climbing down from the ramparts of [[Old Vizima]] after having fought his way from the [[Dike]] where he arrived. They are trying to reach the [[field hospital]] which has been setup by [[Shani]], but can not make it unescorted through the fighting in the streets. They need the witcher's help.

{{path-neutral}}{{Condition|Text = Note}} This entry is only possible to obtain by choosing the [[The Witcher storyline|Witcher / Neutral path]] in the game.

Their romance card is available if you return to the [[Field hospital]] after escorting [[Shani]] to the [[Druids' cave]] in the [[Swamp cemetery]]. The front door will be locked after escorting Shani, so you'll have to use the other door. They're usually upstairs.
