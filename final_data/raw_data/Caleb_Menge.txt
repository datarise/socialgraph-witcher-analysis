'''Caleb Menge''' was the [[commander]] of the [[Temple Guard]] and leader of the [[witch hunter]]s for some time prior to, and until {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

== Journal Entry ==
: ''In those days rampant persecution and the smoke of a hundred pyres choked [[Novigrad]]'s air. This grim climate provided cover in which a great many bloody butchers built comfortable nests for themselves. Drummed-up conspiracies, mass arrests and show trials resulting in group executions were the favorite building blocks.''
: ''Caleb Menge, the fanatically ambitious commander of the Church of the [[Eternal Fire]]'s Temple Guard, was one such opportunist, his moment of triumph coming when he unmasked his superior, the former Temple Guard commander Chappelle, as a doppler in disguise.''
: ''Geralt first saw Menge lighting [[Chappelle]]'s pyre in Novigrad's main square and had no doubt that, for this man, the appellation "fanatical whoreson" was too mild by far.''
: ''Which is why I was not pleased - to say the least - when an unfortunate turn of events led to my capture by the agents of this vile man.''
: ''The paranoid executioner never set a foot outside his fortified headquarters without a crowd of armed guards to accompany him. Knowing my life was on the line, my friends decided to pursue a risky plan to infiltrate Menge's offices - their only hope for a face-to-face meeting with the man.''
: ''Menge only confirmed Geralt's initial impression of his bestiality upon closer acquaintance.''
: '''If Geralt peacefully talked to Menge and didn't ask about the treasure:'''
:: ''Luckily Triss' dagger ended this madman's life and rid the world of one the more hideous monsters to ever walk its surface.''
: '''If Geralt fought the witch hunters or asked about the treasure:'''
:: ''Luckily the witcher's blade ended this madman's life and rid the world of one the more hideous monsters to ever walk its surface.''

== Associated Quests ==
* [[Count Reuven's Treasure]]
* [[Pyres of Novigrad]]

== Notes ==
* Menge's entry originally stated that "''the witcher's blade ended this madman's life" ''even if Triss was the one to kill him. This appears to have been fixed with a later patch.
