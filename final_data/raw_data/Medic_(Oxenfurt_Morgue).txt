This '''medic''' ran the impromptu [[Oxenfurt Morgue|morgue]] in [[Oxenfurt]] around {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}.

Despite his profession, he appeared to show no regard for those he viewed as low status. In particular, with a [[Gael|mysterious monster]] running around and killing drunk beggars and vagrants, he hadn't even bothered to do an autopsy on the victims, and forgot to even burn the bodies.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Contract: The Oxenfurt Drunk]]

==Notes==
* He can be heard singing [[Milo Vanderbeck]]'s motto "Stitch red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white."
