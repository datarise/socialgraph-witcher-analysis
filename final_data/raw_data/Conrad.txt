'''Conrad''' hangs out at [[The Hairy Bear]] in the slums of the [[Temple Quarter]]. He was quite the wine snob and gave Geralt the [[A Most Uncommon Wine]] quest. He did not hang around the inn all the time, but he was there every evening. You could do a drinking contest with him, but there was no reward.

He was also present in Chapter III but appears no different.
