}}'''Piet''' is a minor character and [[Redania]]n Soldier who appears in {{Tw3}} in the end of mission, The Great Escape. He is a member of the Town Patrol of [[Oxenfurt]] and assigned to [[Deireadh prison]]. He is one of numerous guards tasked with safeguarding outer ring of prison from any possible intruders. Even though he is not fond of [[mage]]s, he feels pity for sorceresses and sorcerers tortured by a [[witch hunter]]s inside of the prison because, as he says, at the end they are also humans.
