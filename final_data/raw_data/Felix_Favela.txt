'''Felix Favela''' was a secondary character in {{Tw2}}.

He can be found in [[Vergen]] during [[Chapters|Chapter II]], near the merchants [[Spark]] and [[Mael]] on [[Rhundurin Square]]. When spoken to, Felix says he was there when the massacre of the [[nonhuman]]s occurred in [[Flotsam]], and that he has a gift for Geralt: an Axe and a [[Dwarven enhancement]].

== Trivia ==
* Note Felix is marked with a blue dot on the minimap.
* This encounter is probably linked to helping the non-humans (a dwarf was among them) in the streets of Flotsam, when the massacre is afoot.
