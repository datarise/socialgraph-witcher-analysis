The '''desperate merchant''' can be found wandering up and down the [[Vizima dike]] in Chapter III. It seemed that he was in need of the services of a [[witcher]] to retrieve a [[The Ring|family ring]] lost in the swamp. Apparently his relative was attacked by monsters near the [[Shrine of Melitele|Melitele's shrine]] and when he tried to run away he only fled farther into swamp and the path of danger. Needless to say, he perished and with him, somewhere in the [[swamp]] was a valuable ring.
