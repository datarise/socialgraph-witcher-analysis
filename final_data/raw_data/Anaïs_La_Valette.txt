'''Anaïs La Valette''' was the daughter of [[Mary Louisa La Valette]] and sister of [[Boussy La Valette|Boussy]]. Who her father was is not known for sure. Officially, it was the [[Old Baron La Valette]], but many rumors persist that she and her brother were actually [[King]] [[Foltest]] of [[Temeria]]'s progeny. If this is true, then both she and her brother were in line for the Temerian throne.

In Chapter II, if [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] chose [[Vernon Roche|Roche]]'s path, he learned that Boussy was accidentally killed in the attempt to kidnap the siblings, leaving Anaïs the sole heir to the throne. If Geralt handed her over to [[John Natalis]], Roche will later inform Geralt that when Natalis tried to give her a doll to play with, she refused, stating she wanted a sword and to learn how to fight.

== Journal Entry ==
: ''The daughter of [[Baroness]] Mary Louisa La Valette was a scant few summers old at the time. Rumors that King Foltest was her father gave beginning to many important events.''

== Associated Quests ==
* [[The Assassins of Kings]]
* [[Of His Blood and Bone]]

==Note==
* [[Of His Blood and Bone]] is a quest related to a kidnapped Anaïs that Geralt must free. You can unlock this quest only if you chose to side with [[Roche]] at the end of Chapter I, and if you choose to follow Vernon after [[For Temeria!]] quest, in Chapter III, instead of saving Triss.
* During the whole game she does not say anything directly.
* In the novel {{BoE}} it is only said that Maria Luiza and King Foltest were in love, but nothing about common children.
