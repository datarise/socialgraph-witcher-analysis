If you'd o' heard the cries, sir... if you'd o' heard how a man can scream... how he can suffer|citation = The survivor talking about [[Hendrik]], {{Tw3}}}}The unnamed '''Survivor''' was the only one who survived when [[Heatherton]] was attacked by the [[Wild Hunt]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. However, he was so distraught by what happened to everyone else that when [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] approached to find out what happened to the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] spy, Hendrik, he had to use [[Axii]] to calm the survivor down. Afterwards, the survivor told Geralt what happened that fateful night.
