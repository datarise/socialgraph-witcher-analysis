== Biography ==
In 1272, [[Dandelion]] contacted Polly to recruit her for his planned cabaret at the premises of the former [[Rosemary and Thyme]]. However, Polly's betrothed Hubio was against the idea of her working there, believing the Rosemary and Thyme to still be a brothel per the old publicity placards which he came across. If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] chose to help Dandelion in setting up the cabaret, they went to Polly's house and settled a domestic dispute between Polly and Hubio, after which she started choreographing shows at the Chameleon.
