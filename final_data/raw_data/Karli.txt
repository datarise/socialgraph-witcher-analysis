== Biography ==
With the villagers incorrectly believing it'd been a [[dragon]], they paid no heed to Karli and practically barged into her home to gape at her sons' bodies.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt helps out}} Initially believing [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] was just like the rest, Karli showed her clear disapproval with the [[witcher]] until he explained he was there to avenge her sons. On learning this, and being asked permission for once to view the bodies, she let the witcher do so.
