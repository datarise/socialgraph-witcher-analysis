'''Athak Akydalv''' was a [[rock troll]] and professional fist fighter who held the title of Champion of Champions in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. Upon his arrival at the arena in [[Hov]] on the island of [[Spikeroog]], Athak won the title by defeating Zama, the previous Champion of Champions. For Geralt to earn the title Champion of Champions, he must defeat the previously-reigning fist fighting champions of [[Novigrad]], [[Velen]], and [[Skellige]], and finally Athak. It is not explicitly stated if Athak also defeated the previously-reigning champions.

== Notes ==

* Initially, the troll's name is not known, and the arena's bookie states he would only reveal it if he is defeated. The troll gives his name if interacted with afterwards.
* In the Polish (original) version it's spelled ''"Asiak Akydałw"'' which is ''"Kasia Władyka"'' backwards, which is the name of one of CDPR quest designers.
