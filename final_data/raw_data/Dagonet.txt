'''Dagonet''' and his friend [[Harmond]] were court jesters and brought along as entertainment when King [[Demavend III]] of [[Aedirn]] decided to sail on the [[Pontar (river)|Pontar]] in {{Year|canon=no|year=1271}}. Unfortunately for them, [[Letho]] chose that day to assassinate the king and threw a magical capsule that froze everyone and thing that wasn't protected from it. Dagonet was caught in the blast and subsequently shattered when the ship began to break apart.

== ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Artbook|The Witcher 2 Digital Artbook]]'' description ==
:''The two jesters display truly clownish humor. Their coarse, at times even vulgar situational comedy was meant as a foil to the monarch's majestic presence. Though this is achieved, they simultaneously underline the king's evidently plebeian tastes. The ruler finds their bumbling funny â€“ as most probably many people in the Middle Ages would.''
