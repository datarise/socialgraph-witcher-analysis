'''Derae''' was one of most requested [[elf|elves]] working at the [[Flotsam brothel]]. You can find her in one of the rooms on the top floor of the same building where both the [[Flotsam inn|inn]] and the brothel are.

Derae was [[Margot]]'s partner. Unfortunately, if you chose to give the sword to [[Iorveth]] at the [[Ruined elven baths|Elven ruins]], during [[The Assassins of Kings]] quest, her beauty will not save her from being a victim of the incidents of Chapter I.
