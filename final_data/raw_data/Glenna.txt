'''Glenna''' was a peasant who once settled in the village of [[Blackbough]].

==Biography==
Glenna once lived in [[Novigrad]] with her husband who was a butcher there. Later, for unknown reasons, the pair relocated to the village of Blackbough in [[Velen]]. Though her husband was still known as a butcher, meat was incredibly scarce in Velen following the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] invasion of the region in the [[Third Nilfgaard War]], and so the couple was forced to subsist on mostly selling other animal parts.

== Associated Quest ==
*[[Wild at Heart]]

==Notes==
*[[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] may speak to Glenna about [[Hanna]]'s disappearance. Glenna believes that Hanna simply wandered off to the forest to pick mushrooms, and was presumably eaten by [[Wolf (creature)|wolves]].
*A conversation with Glenna cannot be started unless the quest objective to talk to her is active.
