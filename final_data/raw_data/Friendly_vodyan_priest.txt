The "'''friendly vodyan priest'''" was a [[vodyanoy]] [[priest|cleric]] from the [[Underwater City]] who tended to an [[Lady of the Lake's altar|altar]] of the [[Lady of the Lake (nymph)|Lady of the Lake]] near [[Murky Waters]].

== Biography ==
He was one of the first [[witcher]] [[Geralt of Rivia]] met upon his arrival in Murky Waters. He told the witcher of [[Berengar]]'s presence in the area and also of the strife brewing between the vodyanoy and local [[human]]s.

Although the friendly priest was often driven away from his post at the foot of the altar by [[Dagon]] [[Dagon worshipper|worshippers]], Geralt dispatched them at that time so that the friendly priest could return.

== Associated Quest ==
* [[Ripples]]

== Notes ==
* In order for him to really return, the main quest [[The Heat of the Day]] must be advanced up to the point of [[Alina]]'s and [[Celina]]'s transformation as well. Otherwise, the enemy vodyanoy will keep respawning.
*If Ripples is completed prior to The Heat of the Day he will move to the [[Altar of Dagon]] on [[Black Tern Island]] and wait there until [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] is awarded [[Aerondight]], after which he will depart for good.
**If you ask him how he is doing at that point he will express how happy he and everyone is.
