'''Carduin''' of [[Lan Exeter]] was a [[Kovir]]ian [[mage]] and member of the [[Council of Wizards]], the lowest chamber within the [[Brotherhood of Sorcerers]].<ref name="toc">{{ToC}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Thanedd Coup===
At the end of June {{Year|year=1267|canon=yes}}, he travelled to [[Thanedd Island]] to participate in the [[Thanedd coup|Grand Mage's Assembly]] between the Council and [[Chapter of the Gift and the Art|Chapter]]. He participated in the banquet in [[Aretuza]] and later helped [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] bring the wounded [[Dorregaray]] to [[Marti Södergren]] during the coup. He was considered a neutral participant and survived the incident.<ref name="toc" />

=={{tw2}}==
'''Carduin''' was the main spokesman for the new Council and Conclave during the deliberations in [[Loc Muinne]]. Also using the [[Dearhenna]]'s [[Megascope]] he can be seen plotting conspiracy together with [[Radovid V]] during a game of chess.

=== Journal Entry ===
: ''Carduin of Lan Exeter had once been a member of the Council of Sorcerers. During the Thanedd coup he had attempted to maintain both reason and neutrality. He certainly offered proof of the former when it turned out that those conspiring with [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaard]] thought nothing of his impartiality - teleporting back to Kovir was an extremely reasonable, and life-saving, course of action.''
: '''If Geralt chooses to rescue [[Triss Merigold|Triss]] during Chapter III:'''
:: ''After hearing the accusations against [[Síle de Tansarville|Síle]], Carduin demonstrated keen intuition and political savvy. He immediately demanded that she be removed from the Conclave, thus proclaiming the newly formed institution's stance on the matter.''
:'''If Geralt chooses not to rescue Triss during Chapter III:'''
:: ''Their protests were for naught – Carduin and the other mages were arrested in connection with the accusations against the [[Lodge of Sorceresses]].''

== {{tw3}} ==
'''Carduin '''can appear once more depending on dialogue choices during [[Imperial Audience]]. If Geralt tells General [[Morvran Voorhis|Morvran]] that he had to save Triss, then you can meet him in Oxenfurt near Radovid's ship [[HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor]].

=== Journal Entry ===
: ''Carduin of Kovir was once a wealthy and influential member of the Council of Sorcerers, a man known and respected by all the rulers of the [[Northern Kingdoms|North]]. After the Council imploded during the coup on Thanedd Isle, Carduin spared no expense in his quest to rebuild his brotherhood's hard-won position.''
: ''This motivated him to take part in the eventful summit in Loc Muinne, during which a handful of mages seeking to reactivate the Council were forced to accept [[King]] Radovid's patronage. After that Carduin found himself on the king's leash, completely dependent on the whims and moods of a mad ruler whom he served not out of respect but fear. The mage's pride, however, forced him to don a brave face and play out the hand fate had dealt him.''
