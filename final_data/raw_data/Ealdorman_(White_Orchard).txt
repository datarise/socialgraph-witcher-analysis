The '''Ealdorman''' of [[White Orchard]] was once only a peasant and farmer but was later given the position of ealdorman of the small region. The villagers weren't bothered by this until [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] [[Imperial army|army]] came.

== Biography ==
Since the Nilfgaardian army came to White Orchard, the ealdorman had to discuss everything with them and their leader [[Peter Saar Gwynleve]] as the black army had taken over their region in {{Year|canon=no|year=1272}}. While they didn't want to rely too much on the locals, they did require a percentage of their resources. After the ealdorman stated they could give a certain number of [[Bushel|bushels]] of grain, Peter told him to give them a lesser amount. However, when the ealdorman returned, he gave them instead 30 bushels of rotten grain. To set an example, Peter then ordered the ealdorman to be punished by Nilfgaardian decree: fifteen lashes with a [[knout]].
