|Profession = Merchant}}'''Manfred''' was a well informed merchant passing through on the roads between [[Novigrad]] and [[Oxenfurt]] in {{Year|canon = no|year = 1272}}. At one point he stopped and camped out with two others: a [[Redania]]n soldier named [[Rufus]] and a sorcerer named [[Theophile Maria Rosco]].

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by to talk and refuses to get involved or helps Rufus}} Rufus killed Manfred, believing he was a spy, though he had no proof. On searching Manfred's body, he felt the [[Nilfgaardian Empire|Nilfgaardian]] [[Floren|florens]] the merchant had been carrying were enough to justify his suspicions.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by to talk but then defends Manfred}} Sadly, [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] had no other choice but to kill Rufus, who was dead set on killing Manfred, believing he was a spy.

{{Condition|Text = If Geralt stops by but leaves after introduction}} Rufus and Manfred remained passive, and the original three men continued to camp out.
