'''Linus Maravel''' was an eccentric nobleman with one of the largest armies in [[Temeria]]. He was different from typical noblemen of his country and as such had many opponents, most notable being Baron [[Ravanen Kimbolt]] with an army of a similar size.

Maravel was a traitor to Temeria who allied himself with the [[Nilfgaardian Empire]], killed [[Boussy La Valette|Boussy]], and brought [[Anaïs La Valette|Anaïs]] to [[Dethmold]] in exchange for the Nilfgaard's backing his claim to a throne in [[Vizima]].

If [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]] managed to reveal his betrayal, Constable [[John Natalis]] arrested him immediately. Provided that Geralt also revealed Baron Kimbolt's plan to kill Boussy, the [[witcher]] was awarded the [[Medal of Distinguished Service to Temeria]]. Despite this, Natalis only arrested Maravel as he didn't have the manpower to control both men's armies.
== Journal Entry ==
: ''Count Maravel belonged to that singular category of individuals who can strike a bargain with anyone, who are so pragmatic in their thinking that they can persuade, at least in part, even those most strongly opposed to their viewpoint. Maravel thoroughly enjoyed the game of Temerian politics. He was an active and reputedly highly effective player, in addition to being one of the country's most influential aristocrats. Much like Baron Kimbolt, he had grand ambitions, yet he held them in check and was much more ingenious and precise in pursuing his plans.''
: ''One of Maravel's more daring schemes involved kidnapping Foltest's children as they traveled to Loc Muinne in a convoy. I should add that the count had reached an agreement with the Nilfgaardians, promising to deliver Boussy and Anais to the Black Ones in exchange for their backing his claim to the Temerian throne. Though he wanted Temeria to be strong, he had committed treason.''
: ''Having completed his investigation, Geralt concluded that Maravel was guilty of Boussy's death. The witcher gave the rogue up to John Natalis.''
: ''Although Geralt suspected that Maravel had committed many a despicable act, he decided that the count would not answer for Boussy's disappearance. Thus the nobleman remained an innocent man in John Natalis' eyes.''
