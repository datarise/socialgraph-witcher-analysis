=== [[The Witcher journal|Journal]] Entry ===
: ''I met Count de Wett at [[Declan Leuvaarden|Leuvaarden]]'s reception. He hails from Nilfgaard, belongs to the Order of the Flaming Rose and advises [[King]] [[Foltest]] on behalf of the Order. He is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, and he came to hate me from the moment we met. De Wett arrived at the party in the company of Princess Adda. I sense there is something going on between them.''
: ''De Wett turned out to be the sworn enemy of [[Thaler (spy)|Thaler]], the chief of the Temerian intelligence service."''
: ''The Order acknowledged De Wett's achievements and promoted the rat. I don't know what the [[count]] did in response, but it apparently pleased his superiors.''
: ''The Nilfgaardian spilt the beans. Now I am certain he is to blame for the return of Adda's striga curse.''
: ''I killed De Wett in a fight. One less son of a bitch to worry about.''

'''Only if Geralt kills both the werewolf and the striga''':
: ''I encountered De Wett's ghost in the Ice Plains.''

* In the {{BaW}}, a letter can be found at the [[Tourney Grounds]] that mentions him as well.
