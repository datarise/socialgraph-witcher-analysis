'''Adalbert''' was a crossbowman of the [[City Guard]] who fought in the ranks of the [[Order of the Flaming Rose]].

He participated in fierce battles to take control of the [[Trade Quarter]], resulting in the Order winning a Pyrrhic victory. A seriously wounded Adalbert went with his remaining strength to the [[Cloister]] of the Flaming Rose in the [[Temple Quarter]]. Being in a state of agony, he informed [[Jacques de Aldersberg]] what happened, and then told the Master about the death of [[Roderick de Wett]] caused by [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]]. The Grand Master then thanked the soldier for his faithful service, just before Adalbert died from his wounds.
