The '''Order quartermaster''' is one of the few merchants in [[Old Vizima]] from whom Geralt can buy items, if of course he is on good terms with the [[Order of the Flaming Rose|Order]] at this point in the game. Brimming with self-confidence, the quartermaster is of the opinion that the Order's superior organization and logistics will lead to their certain victory, and of course they have the blessing of the [[Eternal Fire]].

If Geralt has chosen the Order path, then the quartermaster can be found on the western outskirts of Old Vizima, not far from [[Jean Pierre]] and the [[Breach in the wall]]. On the Scoia'tael path, the merchant is the [[Scoia'tael quartermaster]].
