'''Haren Brogg''' was a local merchant and [[The Witcher dice poker|dice poker]] enthusiast who lived in the [[fishing village]] in the [[Outskirts]]. His demeanour changed to suit the occasion, so the first impression of him was not one which inspired much trust. Since the [[The Witcher: Enhanced Edition|Enhanced Edition]] of the game, he also now stuttered.

He appeared to have dealings with [[Havekar|hawker]]s, but the exact nature of the dealings was unclear. Is he a hawker? It was also possible that he had sold out [[Scoia'tael|Squirrels]] for gold.

He also recognized [[Zoltan]]'s name.
