The '''Innkeep''' at the [[Rosemary and Thyme|Rosemary and Thyme / Chameleon]] is a [[Gwent players|Gwent player]], using the [[Monsters Gwent deck|Monsters deck]]. You will only be able to met him at the tavern during the evening and night.

He was hired after [[Dandelion]] had the place refurbished, by answering an ad which read:
:''"Help wanted, to assist in the oversight of an exclusive establishment with refined diversions. Baccalaureate freshly gained, ten years of tavern experience a plus, knowledge of the Common Tongue, Elder Tongue and contemporary poetry required."''

Later he admitted to Geralt:
:''Bah, I never passed the entrance exam. Neither do I know a lick of Elder, though I can, indeed, play a ditty or three.''
:''Also, I've committed all Master Dandelion's works to memory.''
