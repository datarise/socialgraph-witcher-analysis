Mislav was a hunter who lived in a small hut near White Orchard.    When he was younger, he served as the local lord's hunter in his employer's manor until Dieter, another servant, discovered the homosexual relationship between Mislav and Florian, the lord's son. Dieter outed them and Mislav was exiled from the manor and became an outcast. When Geralt came to White Orchard in the May of 1272, he was contracted by Captain Peter Saar Gwynleve to kill the griffin that was prowling the area, and he would provide Geralt with information about the location of Yennefer. After Geralt agreed, he was given two names, Tomira, the local herbalist and Mislav, the local hunter. Geralt found Mislav in the woods, hunting a pack of wild dogs, in which he got assistance from Geralt. Mislav then showed him the camp where the griffin attacked a group of Nilfgaardian soldiers. Geralt thanked Mislav, and continued on his hunt.    If Geralt finds the griffin's nest on his own, Mislav can still be found outside his hut, but it would not be possible to start a conversation with him.
