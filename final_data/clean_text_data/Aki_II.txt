If Geralt trusts Cerys an Craite to try her way first: As part of her plan, Cerys made a point to show she was "kidnapping" Aki and had Udalryk and some of his guards chase her to Udalryk's old family home.

If Geralt put Aki in the oven: Aki was thrown into the oven but, unbeknownst to the witcher, he was safely retrieved from the other side by Hjort, who Cerys was able to convince to help with her plan.
