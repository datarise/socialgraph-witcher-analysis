Sheldon Skaggs was a dwarven officer in the Mahakam Volunteer Army, a dwarven infantry unit. He was described as powerful for his race, with an impressive beard reaching to his belt. He was a veteran of the Battles of Brenna and Sodden Hill.    In 1263, he travelled to Upper Sodden to defend against the invading Nilfgaardian Army led by Menno Coehoorn. He fought in the ensuring first battle, and survived despite the Nilfgaardian victory, and travelled north into Lower Sodden. After several northern armies united on Sodden Hill, the famous battle of the same name took place, and the pushback of the Nilfgaardian's successful. In 1267, he was invited to the giant oak Bleobheris in Velen, and got into an argument with Donimir of Troy at Dandelion's concert beneath the tree.    Sheldon Skaggs is a main character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He could be found in Vergen during Chapter II.    I met the dwarf Sheldon Skaggs for the first time, if I remember correctly, a few years back under the ancient oak Bleobheris, where I treated the local count-palatine and the public gathered in great numbers to hear my performance. Skaggs is a mighty warrior, straightforward like all his folk, plain of word, yet at the same time sensitive about his race, and especially the honor of dwarven women. As a veteran of Sodden and Brenna, where he fought as an officer of the Mahakam Volunteer Detachment, he appreciates songs of military and heroic deeds. He does not hesitate to express his appreciation through material means, thus disproving those who would portray all dwarves as misers insensitive to true art.    In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Sheldon has a gwent card that bears his image.
