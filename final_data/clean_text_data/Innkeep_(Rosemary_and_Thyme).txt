The Innkeep at the Rosemary and Thyme / Chameleon is a Gwent player, using the Monsters deck. You will only be able to met him at the tavern during the evening and night. He was hired after Dandelion had the place refurbished, by answering an ad which read:  "Help wanted, to assist in the oversight of an exclusive establishment with refined diversions. Baccalaureate freshly gained, ten years of tavern experience a plus, knowledge of the Common Tongue, Elder Tongue and contemporary poetry required." Later he admitted to Geralt:  Bah, I never passed the entrance exam. Neither do I know a lick of Elder, though I can, indeed, play a ditty or three. Also, I've committed all Master Dandelion's works to memory.
