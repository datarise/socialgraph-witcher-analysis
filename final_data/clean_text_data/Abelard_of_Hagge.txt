Abelard of Hagge was an alumnus of the academy at Ban Ard and was considered a wise, wealthy, learned scholar and sage.    In 1271, he was with Aedirn's king, Demavend III, one fateful day when they were out on a ship on the Pontar river. While he was not amused with the entertainment, he was highly perceptive and quickly cast a protective spell when he saw a capsule flying through the air that froze everything, saving the king, Tybalt, Himsbach, Anselm, and himself from being frozen. When the assassin, Letho, made his move and engaged in a fight with the survivors, Abelard tried to cast a fireball but Letho deftly evaded it, using one of the king's own soldiers to take the hit instead. He was then swiftly cut down by the witcher, leaving the king defenseless.    The mage is a relatively enigmatic character. We do not know if he is a royal advisor or if the king simply invited him along for the river cruise. He appears to be something of an outsider and is clearly disgusted by the on board entertainment. After coming across initially as a "boring sorcerer," viewers should be surprised by his spectacular reaction and the composure he demonstrates as he assumes a leading role during the clash.
