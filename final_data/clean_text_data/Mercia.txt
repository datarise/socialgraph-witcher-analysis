Mercia was a prostitute in Crippled Kate's brothel in Novigrad during 1272. Unlike some of her fellow coworkers, Mercia didn't much care for her job as a prostitute but believed others felt the same way about their jobs, like her man who cleaned fish for a living and couldn't get the stink out no matter what, and her mother who made pots for a living, leaving her hands extremely calloused.    Mercia was the name of one of the kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon's England.    Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either Triss Merigold or Yennefer and will not affect any of the romance endings Geralt can receive. For some reason, Mercia's character model (when naked) has the largest breasts out of all available prostitutes in the game.
