Bertha was a prostitute working at Crippled Kate's in Novigrad during 1272. Despite some looking down on such a line of work, Bertha enjoyed her job and was putting away savings to one day own her own brothel.    Note that employing the services of strumpets at Crippled Kate's will never result in any backlash from either Triss or Yennefer and will not affect any of the romance endings Geralt can receive.    In Patch 1.30, Bertha always wears a top during sex scenes.
