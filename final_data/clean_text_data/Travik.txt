Travik was one of the orphans that Gran looked after in a small village in Crookback Bog in 1272.    Travik used to live with his parents somewhere in the Northern Kingdoms when Nilfgaard invaded. On that day, he'd been hunting for berries and on the way home he heard the soldiers kill his parents. He later ended up in the care of Gran in Crookback Bog, as did many other children orphaned by the war. There, he made friends with a godling named Johnny, whom he directed Geralt to when the witcher was searching for Ciri in Velen. If Geralt freed the Ghost in the Tree: Travik, along with all the other orphans from Crookback Bog, was saved by the Ghost from the Crones. The orphans later ended up in Novigrad, and were placed under the care of Marabella at her school. If Geralt killed the Ghost in the Tree: Travik, along with all the other orphans from Crookback Bog, was taken to Aard Cerbin by the Crones, where he was killed and consumed by them.    Out of all the orphans, he's considered the closest to Johnny and likes to eat snails with the godling. He's also unafraid of the woods, like the rest of the children are, though Genny will comment he's not brave, he's just stupid, as one time he sat his bare butt down on an anthill.
