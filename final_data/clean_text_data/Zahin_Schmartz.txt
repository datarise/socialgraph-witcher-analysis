Zahin Schmartz was a dwarf with a nasal condition and a dentist who moved into the house vacated by Detective Raymond Maarloeve's untimely death. He collected teeth, and sniffed a lot. During Chapter III, he could be found either at his residence, or wandering about town. He seemed to particularly enjoy chatting with the vendors on Merchant Street in the Temple Quarter. He could also be found in Old Vizima in Chapter V, inhabiting an empty (former executioner's) tower just beside the hole in the wall that leads to the swamp cemetery.    Won't Hurt a Bit    His name, "Zahin Schmartz" is most likely a joke pointing to the German word "Zahnschmerz", meaning toothache. He says he is allergic to the herbs used in anesthetics, so doesn't use any on his patients. After bringing him Alp teeth, he states that Alps inject their victims with a type of (presumably non-herbal) anesthesia, and that he may be able to come up with something that doesn't aggravate his allergies.
