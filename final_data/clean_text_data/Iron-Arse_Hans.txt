Iron-Arse Hans was a horse racer outside Crow's Perch and, by his appearance, a mercenary. His horse was called Beecher. No matter what order he's raced against, he will give saddlebags and 30  when beaten. Sometimes when racing him an obstacle (loose barrels or a log) may appear.    Races: Crow's Perch
