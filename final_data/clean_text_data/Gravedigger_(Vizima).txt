The Gravedigger, unknown by name, worked as a digger of graves. He can be found during the day at his post outside the Vizima cemetery gate, in the Temple Quarter. He is certainly never adverse to a bottle of the good stuff. He apparently has a penchant for dwarven tinctures. He is the guy to talk to about anything to do with the cemetery or dead bodies.
