Throughout The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there are a number of gwent players. This is a complete list of every player, separated by game and regions. † This denotes players that can die or disappear from the game. With Patch 1.08, these cards can be found at locations, typically near where the character resided.                                  Note that most players will give a specific Skellige card as a reward for beating them (those who don't are marked as n/a).

With Patch 1.08, these cards can be found at locations, typically near where the character resided.
