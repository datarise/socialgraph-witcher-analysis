There are two merchants in Blackbough:     This merchant is near a cart/wagon and sells some crafting components, but most of his wares are animal hides. He does not play gwent.    It should be noted that he's one of the few "traveling" merchants and will spawn in different, predefined locations, though he sometimes disappears a few days at a time. For more information, see Moving merchant.     This merchant plays gwent, using the Nilfgaardian Empire deck, and sells Adalbert Kermith's first map among other things.
