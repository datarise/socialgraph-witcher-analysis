The swordsmith in Mulbrydale is a gwent player, using the Monsters deck, and despite his misleading name, is an amateur armorer. If freed from his captives in Swamp Bint Harbor, he'll head back home and will then offer his services to Geralt.    Person in Distress    There's a known bug where he'll appear next to his workbench but be unavailable to talk with. A save and reload of the area, or simply meditating, fixes this.
