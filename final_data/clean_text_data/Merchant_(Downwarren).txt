The merchant is a gwent player, but doesn't sell any gwent cards. Although he claims to sell milk, he does not have any in his stock. Instead, he sells water, bread, and alcoholic beverages that can be used in alchemy such as: Temerian rye, Mandrake cordial, Cherry cordial, and Nilfgaardian lemon. The random gwent card can be won from him. The merchant disappears from the village and his services become unavailable if the Ghost in the Tree is freed or killed during the quest The Whispering Hillock.    He boasts a particularly pathetic Monsters Gwent deck where nearly all of his Muster cards are impaired, except for the Nekker which he has 2 instead of 3. Which makes him an easy source of income at the beginning of the game.
