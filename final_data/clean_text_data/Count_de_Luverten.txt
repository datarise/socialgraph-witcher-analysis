Count de Luverten was the youngest of the Duke de Salm, from its ruling family well-known and rich from trading with gems. He was a friend of Vegelbuds and portraitist Henri Rautlec.    In 1272, Rautlec promised Dandelion to make new posters for Chameleon but since he got in debt again he couldn't bring them. The Count met with Henri on races in front of Vegelbud Residence to discuss this and he offered a deal to the halfling that he would pay his debt if he wagered one more time on a racer and won.
