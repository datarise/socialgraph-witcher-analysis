Freek was a Redanian archer serving on HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor to protect King Radovid V.    In 1272, while the HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor was docked in the Novigrad Docks, he and his comrades, Caspar, Jouke, and witch hunter Egbert were commanded by King Radovid to stay near the gate to St. Gregory's Bridge and secure the area. He was killed by the hand of either Geralt, Ves, Roche or some Temerian partisan.    Reason of State
