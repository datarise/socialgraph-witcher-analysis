The Havekar (Elder Speech: hav'caaren), also known as hawkers, are opportunistic smugglers who sell arms and supplies to the Scoia'tael at high prices, lining their own pockets on the misfortune of others. They have been known to renege on deals and sell out their own "clients" for the right price or incentive, often taking advantage of the worsening relations between the elves and the humans to make profit. Havekar are looked upon with contempt by both humans and elves. They tended to be primarily human, but their membership does include some assimilated elves and dwarves. They appear in Baptism of Fire, the third novel in the Blood of Elves saga.
