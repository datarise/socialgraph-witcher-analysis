The Grossbart Brothers were a trio of Skelliger brothers who murdered, raped, and burned down homes so severely a bounty was put out on them in 1272, drawing the attention of Djenge Frett, a bounty hunter in the area. At the time, the three were camping out in the Grotto on Ard Skellig.     Hegel preferred to fight with a heavy blunt axe.     Jesse tended to go for a bow, staying at a distance, though he'd switch to a small blunt axe when cornered.      Manfred preferred to fight with a sword.    The Sad Tale of the Grossbart Brothers    They are most likely a reference to the book The Sad Tale of the Brothers Grossbart by Jesse Bullington, in which a pair of ne'er-do-well brothers traverse medieval Europe and encounter witches, demons, and other supernatural monsters in their search for treasure.
