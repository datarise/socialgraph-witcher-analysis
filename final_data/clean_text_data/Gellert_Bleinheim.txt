Gellert Bleinheim is the "drug lord" heading up the fisstech production operation for Salamandra in the Sewers beneath Vizima's Temple Quarter (Chapter III). The Fisstech lab is guarded by two thugs who ask Geralt for a password in order to enter. Geralt can tell them that "thorn" is the password and enter peacefully or he may opt to fistfight them and gain entrance that way. After clearing the Fisstech lab, Gellert Bleinheim and his thugs are found at the Southmost part of the Sewers (where the tunnels form a "Y" on the map). He carries the Key to Salamandra code, which is used to decipher the Encrypted document found in the Fisstech lab.    Gellert Bleinheim is Roland Bleinheim's brother.
