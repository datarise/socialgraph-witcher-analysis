The Order quartermaster is one of the few merchants in Old Vizima from whom Geralt can buy items, if of course he is on good terms with the Order at this point in the game. Brimming with self-confidence, the quartermaster is of the opinion that the Order's superior organization and logistics will lead to their certain victory, and of course they have the blessing of the Eternal Fire. If Geralt has chosen the Order path, then the quartermaster can be found on the western outskirts of Old Vizima, not far from Jean Pierre and the Breach in the wall. On the Scoia'tael path, the merchant is the Scoia'tael quartermaster.  food Non-alcoholic beverages Bomb making bases Blade enhancements a variety of Order weapons other short weapons
