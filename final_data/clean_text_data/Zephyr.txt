Zephyr was a drowned dead haunting the waters of Lakeside by Murky Waters.    According to a story told by the Naiad, Zephyr was one of Vizima's most famous thieves before his death. Apparently, on his last escape attempt through the city sewers, his loot proved too heavy and his greed go great for him to survive and he drowned trying to keep it all. Somehow, he ended up becoming a drowned dead – otherwise common post-Conjunction monster and not a cursed form but the poetic Naiad might as well have made the story up – and became the leader of the lakeside drowners near Murky Waters. His theft of the Naiad's turquoise necklace was behind the Naiad's request when Geralt of Rivia first met her in 1270.    Despite being a drowned dead, he drops drowner brain tissue.
