Djenge Frett was a bounty hunter in Skellige around 1272 who considered himself the most famous bounty hunter north of the Yaruga.    In 1272, he found himself scouring Skellige for the Grossbart Brothers, a trio who had done so many misdeeds a bounty had been placed on their heads. If Geralt helps him: with the witcher's help, Djenge was able to bring an end to the brothers' reign of terror. If Geralt doesn't help him: unfortunately Djenge overestimated himself and tried to take on the brothers by himself and met his end.    The Sad Tale of the Grossbart Brothers    His name and profession are both a reference to Jango Fett, a bounty hunter in the Star Wars series or to Django, another bounty hunter in the movie Django Unchained.
