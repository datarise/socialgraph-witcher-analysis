Stan Fishgulper, known to the locals simply as Fisherman, was one of the fistfighters in Velen who lived in Lindenvale. If one chooses to participate in the fighting tournaments, he can be fought. However, he makes a small request from Geralt prior to doing so: he needs the reward (a sack of flour) to feed his family and asks that you throw the match. If agreed, you can throw the match then do a rematch to continue the quest. If you choose not to throw the match, you can still give him a small sum later to feed his family if you want to.
