Damiaan was a Redanian archer who served on HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, protecting King Radovid V. In 1272, he and his comrades, Caspar, Jouke, Freek and witch hunter Egbert were commanded by King Radovid to stay near the gate to St. Gregory's Bridge and secure the area. He died by the hand of either Geralt, Ves, Roche or some Temerian partisan.    Reason of State
