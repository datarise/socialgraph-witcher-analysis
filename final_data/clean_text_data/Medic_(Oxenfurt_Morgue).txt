This medic ran the impromptu morgue in Oxenfurt around 1272. Despite his profession, he appeared to show no regard for those he viewed as low status. In particular, with a mysterious monster running around and killing drunk beggars and vagrants, he hadn't even bothered to do an autopsy on the victims, and forgot to even burn the bodies.    Contract: The Oxenfurt Drunk    He can be heard singing Milo Vanderbeck's motto "Stitch red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white."
