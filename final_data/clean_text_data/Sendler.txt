Sendler is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He is a merchant, craftsman, and dice poker player who can be found in a building with fish hanging outside, southwest of Anezka's house in Lobinden.    In Lobinden tanning and leather-working was the trade of Sendler, a skilful and reliable artisan. He ran a small stall with goods of his own making, but also accepted commissions for specific products. In these hard times, he made ends meet by working hard with his own hands.    The first time (and only the first) that Geralt defeats Sendler at dice poker, he may take one of three trap diagrams as a prize instead of the orens in the pot. A stuffed troll head hangs on the wall of Sendler's hut. It can be useful if the witcher seeks ingredients for a certain ritual (for the tongue has not been removed), or if he wishes to provide the nearby bridge troll with some closure. Unfortunately, Sendler will neither give it away nor sell it outright - he must be defeated (a second time!) at dice poker.
