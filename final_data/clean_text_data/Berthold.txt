Berthold was an alchemist based in Novigrad.    In 1272, during the witch hunts in Novigrad, Berthold and wife Anisse went into hiding in their house. Approached by Triss Merigold, they were invited on a ship to Kovir to safety. With a plan to meet at The Kingfisher Inn, they became trapped as witch hunters surrounded their house. If Geralt saves them: making the decision to leave none behind, Triss and Geralt went to Anisse and Berthold's hideout and killed the witch hunters there. Berthold and his wife went with the two to The Kingfisher Inn, and escaped to the docks through the Novigrad sewers with the other mages. They boarded the ship and departed for a new and safer life in Kovir.    Now or Never
