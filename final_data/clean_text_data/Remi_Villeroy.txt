Remi Villeroy was a mage from the Northern Kingdoms, who went into hiding in the Farcorners district of Novigrad with his wife, Louisa, and his adoptive son.    In 1272, after the witch hunts broke out, he went on the run from the witch hunters. Officially, they wanted him for contacting the Lodge of Sorceresses via a megascope, and poisoning the minds of Redanian soldiers. If Geralt intervened and helped Remi and his family, the mage thanked him and expressed a desire to give up magic before rewarding Geralt with Perun, Veles, and Chernobog runestones.
