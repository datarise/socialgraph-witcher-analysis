Hanna (d. 1272) was a woman who lived in the village of Blackbough, Velen. She was considered a cheerful person and affectionately called aunt by the blacksmith's children.    Hanna was married to the hunter Niellen, with whom she lived in Blackbough along with Hanna's sister, Margrit. Unbeknownst to Hanna, her husband was in fact a werewolf who secluded himself in the forest during full moons to avoid harming any of the local populace. However, Margrit was incredibly jealous of Hanna's relationship with Niellen, even after she'd learned of Niellen's lycanthropy. Thus, on one of the nights when Niellen transformed, Margrit led Hanna deep into the woods in the hopes that her sister would see Niellen for what he really is and leave him. Tragically, Niellen, while in werewolf form, in a blind bloodlust, ripped Hanna to shreds while Margrit ran off.
