Brean Hotsch was a Nordling halfling who worked as a lumberjack in the 13th century.    Around 1272, Brean saw too good of an opportunity to pass up and bought a section of woods just outside Novigrad, with the idea of creating a lumberjack business here, as it was close to Novigrad's ports. However, the lumberjacks he hired spoke of something evil in the woods though he dismissed this as superstition until one day something massacred nearly all his workers save for one. Finally realizing something was going on, he put out a notice asking for a witcher's help. If Geralt helps him: Geralt eventually tracked down the monster, a young leshen known as Kernun, and killed it. Brean readily paid the witcher for his services and prepared to hire more workers now that the threat was gone.    Contract: Lord of the Wood
