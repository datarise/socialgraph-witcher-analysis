Gavrilo is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He can be found in the Kaedweni camp during Chapter II. Upon meeting Gavrilo, Geralt will recognize him, leading to Gavrilo's confession about having worked for Salamandra and being spared by Geralt. Gavrilo hopes Geralt to bear no grudge and will offer a "trinket" (Robust Well-Balanced Silver Dagger) as compensation.
