Henri Rautlec, called familiarly Hank, was a famed halfling portrait artist and a friend of such names as Dandelion or Count de Luverten.    In 1272, Rautlec was hired by Dandelion to paint new placards for the Chameleon but he got in debt and thus required help to get out of it. After a group of angry creditors seized his home in order to either take him or anything valuable, he ran to the races near Vegelbud Residence where his friend the Count made him an offer: he was to wager on one more race and if he won, the Count would pay all his debts.    Cabaret    This character draws many comparisons with and references the French 19th-century painter and illustrator Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. He produced posters for the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret upon its inaugural opening and had a rather short stature at 1.42 metres (4 ft 8 in) due to stunted leg growth.
