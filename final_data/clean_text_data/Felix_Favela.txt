Felix Favela was a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He can be found in Vergen during Chapter II, near the merchants Spark and Mael on Rhundurin Square. When spoken to, Felix says he was there when the massacre of the nonhumans occurred in Flotsam, and that he has a gift for Geralt: an Axe and a Dwarven enhancement.    Note Felix is marked with a blue dot on the minimap. This encounter is probably linked to helping the non-humans (a dwarf was among them) in the streets of Flotsam, when the massacre is afoot.
