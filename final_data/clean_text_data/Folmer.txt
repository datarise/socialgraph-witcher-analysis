Folmer was a warrior from Ard Skellig, who can be encountered in the town under the Kaer Trolde citadel, with another warrior advising his friend Ruar to not eat so much, as he would likely be in pain and thus unable to go raiding otherwise.    Folmer does not have his own model and will appear in the form of a random warrior.
