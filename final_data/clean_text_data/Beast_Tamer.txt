Beast Tamer was a traveling showman in 1272, selling tickets for people to see rare and exciting creatures like a basilisk. In reality, the guy was either ignorant or deliberately cheating people out of their money, as it wasn't a basilisk he had but a young, ill-fed wyvern. If Geralt intervenes: as he showed off the "basilisk" to a group of Redanian soldiers, the witcher came forth, eventually pointing out it was a wyvern. Realizing they'd been had, the soldiers began to move in to grab the man when the beast's cage suddenly broke and the wyvern got out while the "beast tamer" hid.    The Most Truest of Basilisks    He's a direct reference to a scene in the Time of Contempt, except it was Ciri that pointed out it was a wyvern before the cage broke.
